        "response": "The API, given an ISBN and a language code, is designed to return the URL of the cover image for the specified book. For the given ISBN '9781526606198' and the language code 'en', the corresponding book cover image URL would typically link directly to a repository or a database where the image is stored. However, without access to a real database in this context, a specific URL cannot be provided. In an operational scenario, this API would query a database containing book information, including cover images, and retrieve the URL for the image associated with the ISBN '9781526606198' in the English language. This URL could then be used to view or download the book's cover image."

        "response": "Based on the provided ISBN '9780062982654' and the language code 'en', the API would typically return a URL pointing to the cover image of the book associated with this ISBN. The returned URL enables users to access the book's cover image directly, which can be particularly useful for libraries, bookstores, or individuals looking to categorize or display the book visually. In a live environment, the API interacts with a comprehensive database of book cover images sorted by ISBN and language codes to ensure the correct image is served. However, without actual database access, a specific URL cannot be supplied here. Nonetheless, in practice, this function facilitates easy retrieval of high-quality book cover images for various applications, enhancing digital catalogues and reading platforms by providing visual identifiers for books."
