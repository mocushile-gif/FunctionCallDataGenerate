He finds an ice cream shop and thinks a big bowl of vanilla ice cream will really hit the spot since he's a penguin and it's Arizona in the summer, after all. He sits down at the counter and starts in on his ice cream. Of course he has no hands so it is rather messy. By the time he is done he has ice cream all over his flippers and his mouth - a total mess.

The mechanic says he has a few others to look at first but if he comes back in an hour he can tell the penguin what is wrong with his car. The penguin agrees and goes for a walk. He finds an ice cream shop and thinks a big bowl of vanilla ice cream will really hit the spot since he's a penguin and it's Arizona in the summer, after all. He sits down at the counter and starts in on his ice cream. Of course he has no hands so it is rather messy. By the time he is done he has ice cream all over his flippers and his mouth - a total mess. He walks back to the service station and says to the mechanic, \"Did you find out what is wrong with my car?\" The mechanic replies, \"It looks like you've blown a seal.\" \"No, no,\" says the penguin. \"It's just ice cream, I swear!!!\"",

AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.\r\n\r\n    3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old diskettes. After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer had labeled the diskettes, then rolled them into the typewriter to type the labels.\r\n\r\n    4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes. A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along with photocopies of the floppies.\r\n\r\n    5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room.\r\n\r\n    6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the technician discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the \"send\" key.\r\n\r\n    7. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.\r\n\r\n    8. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged because his computer had told him he was \"bad and an invalid\". The tech explained that the computer's \"bad command\" and \"invalid\" responses shouldn't be taken personally.\r\n\r\n    9. A confused caller to IBM was having troubles printing documents. He told the technician that the computer had said it \"couldn't find printer\". The user had also tried turning the computer screen to face the printer - but that his computer still couldn't \"see\" the printer.\r\n\r\n    10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. Her response, \"I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens.\" The \"foot pedal\" turned out to be the computer's mouse.\r\n\r\n    11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new computer wouldn't  work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked \"What power switch?\"\r\n\r\n    12. True story from a Novell NetWire SysOp:\r\n\r\nCaller: \"Hello, is this Tech Support?\"\r\nTech: \"Yes, it is. How may I help you?\"\r\nCaller: \"The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?\"\r\nTech: \"I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?\"\r\nCaller: \"Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer.\"\r\nTech: \"Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, It's because I am. Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a trade show? How did you get this cup holder? Does it   have any trademark on it?\"\r\nCaller: \"It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a promotional. It just has '4X' on it.\" At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive!\r\n\r\n    13. Another IBM customer had troubles installing software and rang for support. \"I put in the first disk, and that was OK. It said to put in the second disk, and had some problems with the disk. When it said to put in the third disk - I couldn't even fit it in...\" The user hadn't realized that \"Insert Disk 2\" meant to remove Disk 1 first.\r\n\r\n    14. In a similar incident, a customer had followed the instructions for installing software. The instructions said to remove the disk from it's cover and insert into the drive. The user had physically removed the casing of the disk and wondered why there were problems.\r\n\r\n    As Ripley would say, believe it or not!",

He would spend the whole evening there and always arrive home, well inebriated, around midnight each night. He usually had trouble getting his key to fit the keyhole and couldn't get the door open. And, every time this happened, his wife would go to the door and let him in. Then, she would proceed to yell and scream at him for his constant nights out and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry still continued his nightly routine. One day, the distraught wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior. The friend listened and suggested, \"Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss? Then, he might change his ways.\" The wife thought that this might be a good idea. That night, Harry took off again after dinner. And, at about midnight, he arrived home in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door. She quickly opened it and let Harry in. Instead of berating him as she had always done, this time she took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat Harry down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the foot stool, and took his shoes off. Then, she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little. After a short while, she whispered to Harry, \"It's pretty late, dear. I think we should go upstairs to bed now, don't you think?\" Harry replied in his inebriated state, \"Heck, I guess we might as well. I'll get in trouble when I get home anyway!\"",

She ran into the passenger seat and pulled the door shut, the car already moving. The security guard yelled, \"Stop!

He would spend the whole evening there and always arrive home, well inebriated, around midnight each night. He usually had trouble getting his key to fit the keyhole and couldn't get the door open. And, every time this happened, his wife would go to the door and let him in. Then, she would proceed to yell and scream at him for his constant nights out and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry still continued his nightly routine. One day, the distraught wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior. The friend listened and suggested, \"Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss? Then, he might change his ways.\" The wife thought that this might be a good idea. That night, Harry took off again after dinner. And, at about midnight, he arrived home in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door. She quickly opened it and let Harry in. Instead of berating him as she had always done, this time she took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat Harry down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the foot stool, and took his shoes off. Then, she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little. After a short while, she whispered to Harry, \"It's pretty late, dear. I think we should go upstairs to bed now, don't you think?\" Harry replied in his inebriated state, \"Heck, I guess we might as well. I'll get in trouble when I get home anyway!\"",

He would spend the whole evening there and always arrive home, well inebriated, around midnight each night. He usually had trouble getting his key to fit the keyhole and couldn't get the door open. And, every time this happened, his wife would go to the door and let him in. Then, she would proceed to yell and scream at him for his constant nights out and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry still continued his nightly routine. One day, the distraught wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior. The friend listened and suggested, \"Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss? Then, he might change his ways.\" The wife thought that this might be a good idea. That night, Harry took off again after dinner. And, at about midnight, he arrived home in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door. She quickly opened it and let Harry in. Instead of berating him as she had always done, this time she took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat Harry down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the foot stool, and took his shoes off. Then, she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little. After a short while, she whispered to Harry, \"It's pretty late, dear. I think we should go upstairs to bed now, don't you think?\" Harry replied in his inebriated state, \"Heck, I guess we might as well. I'll get in trouble when I get home anyway!\"",

Ten-fold she rubs the lamp and out pops a magical genie. The genie notices her anger and lets her vent her troubles to him. As a consolation the genie informs her that he will give her three wishes. But, he cautions her that because he does not believe in divorce, he will give her ex-husband ten times the amount of whatever she wishes. The woman is steaming mad, thinking that this is hardly fair, but she makes her first wish. The first wish was for a billion dollars. The genie grants her wish and she finds herself sitting on a pile on one billion one-dollar bills. The genie then reminds her that her husband is now the recipient of 10 billion dollars. The woman can barely contain her anger when she makes her second wish. The second wish was for a beautiful mansion on the shore of her own private bach. In an instant it was granted, but then genie then reminds her again that her ex-husband now owns ten of what she wished for, and points out at the beach to a small development of ten such mansions. Upon hearing this, the woman takes her time to contemplate her last wish. Just as the genie was about to give up on her, the women informs the genie that she wants to make her last wish. But, before she can do this, the genie warns her that her ex-husband will get ten times what she wishes for. “No problem,” said the woman as she grinned in ecstasy. “For my last wish, I’d like to give birth to twins.”",

Being a city boy by nature, the biologist was disturbed\nby this. He asked the guide, \"What are those drums?\" The guide\nturned to him and said, \"Drums OK, but VERY BAD when they stop.\"\n\nThe biologist settled down a little at this, and things went\nreasonably well for about two weeks. Then, just as they were packing\nup the camp to leave, the drums suddenly stopped!\n\nThis hit the biologist like a ton of bricks, and he yelled at the\nguide, \"The drums have stopped - what happens now?\"\n\nThe guide crouched down, covered his head with his hands and said: \"Bass Solo\"",

Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap.\n\nQ: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?\n\nA: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat?  Hay and corn. And what are these?vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable).  And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily\nallowance of vegetable slop. \n\nQ: Is beer or wine bad for me?\n\nA: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables.  As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories: animal,\nmineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table\nof elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger\nand a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables.\n\nQ: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?\n\nA: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your\nratio is two to one, etc.\n\nQ: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program?\n\nA: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain - Good.\n\nQ: If I stop smoking, will I live longer?\n\nA: Nope. Smoking is a sign of individual statement and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress\nyourself to death in record time.\n\nQ: Aren't fried foods bad for you?\n\nA: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How\ncould getting more vegetables be bad for you?\n\nQ: What's the secret to healthy eating?\n\nA: Thicker gravy.\n\nQ: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle?\n\nA: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger.  You should only be doing sit-ups if you want\na bigger stomach.\n\nQ: Is chocolate bad for me?\n\nA: Are you crazy? Cocoa beans... Another vegetable. It's the best feel good food around!\n\nI hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about food and diets.\n\nHave a cookie... flour is a veggie!",

Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap.\n\nQ: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?\n\nA: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat?  Hay and corn. And what are these?vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable).  And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily\nallowance of vegetable slop. \n\nQ: Is beer or wine bad for me?\n\nA: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables.  As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories: animal,\nmineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table\nof elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger\nand a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables.\n\nQ: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?\n\nA: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your\nratio is two to one, etc.\n\nQ: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program?\n\nA: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain - Good.\n\nQ: If I stop smoking, will I live longer?\n\nA: Nope. Smoking is a sign of individual statement and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress\nyourself to death in record time.\n\nQ: Aren't fried foods bad for you?\n\nA: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How\ncould getting more vegetables be bad for you?\n\nQ: What's the secret to healthy eating?\n\nA: Thicker gravy.\n\nQ: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle?\n\nA: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger.  You should only be doing sit-ups if you want\na bigger stomach.\n\nQ: Is chocolate bad for me?\n\nA: Are you crazy? Cocoa beans... Another vegetable. It's the best feel good food around!\n\nI hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about food and diets.\n\nHave a cookie... flour is a veggie!",

Sidney started the experiment with the bull frog, and told Sophie her job was to write down the results of the experiment.Sidney drew a line in the sand, placed the frog on the line, and prodded the frog with a small twig from the rear and shouted, \"Jump frog!\"The frog jumped and Sidney measured the distance. \"12 feet. Write that down, Sophie.\" he said.Next, he brought the frog back to the starting point and removed the frog's right front leg. Again he prodded the frog and shouted, \"Jump frog!\" The frog jumped 10 feet, and on instruction Sophie wrote it down.Again the frog was brought back, and the left front leg was removed, and again said, \"Jump frog!\" It jumped 6 feet and Sophie wrote it down.Again Sidney tried, this time removing the large right back leg. \"Jump frog! Jump frog!\" he shouted and prodded the frog. The frog jumped 8 inches. \"Write it down, Sophie.\"Finally Sidney removed the frog's remaining back left leg, put it down and prodded the frog with the twig, shouting \"Jump frog! Jump Frog! JUMP FROG! JUMP, JUMP FROG!\"The frog didn't jump. Sophie looked at Sidney, and said, \"So what should I write down?\"Sidney thought a moment, and told Sophie to write, \"When you remove all the legs from a frog, it turns deaf.\"",

After all, she never called in or came back to the office when she left early, so how was she to know?\n\nThe next day, they all three left the office right after the boss left. The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening and went to bed early.\n\nThe redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the health club before meeting her dinner date.\n\nThe blonde was happy, happy, happy to be home, but when she got to the bedroom she heard a muffled noise from inside. Slowly, quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with HER BOSS.\n\nEver so gently, she closed the door and crept out of her house. The next day at coffee break, the brunette and redhead decided they were leaving early again, and asked the blonde if she was coming with them.\n\n\"NO WAY,\" she exclaimed, \"I almost got caught yesterday\"",

He finds an ice cream shop and thinks a big bowl of vanilla ice cream will really hit the spot since he's a penguin and it's Arizona in the summer, after all. He sits down at the counter and starts in on his ice cream. Of course he has no hands so it is rather messy. By the time he is done he has ice cream all over his flippers and his mouth - a total mess. He walks back to the service station and says to the mechanic, \"Did you find out what is wrong with my car?\" The mechanic replies, \"It looks like you've blown a seal.\" \"No, no,\" says the penguin. \"It's just ice cream, I swear!!!\"",
