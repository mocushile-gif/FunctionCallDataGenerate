Heat the red wine in a pan with the balsamic vinegar and simmer rapidly to reduce by about half. 2 Cut a lamb steak into strips. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan, add the lamb and chopped onion and cook quickly to brown. 3 Add the reduced wine and simmer for about 15 minutes. Add the Marmite to the sauce and season with black pepper. 4 Heat a wok, add the coriander, cumin, cloves and caraway seeds and toast for 1-2 minutes. Crush in a pestle and mortar and sprinkle over both sides of the other piece of lamb. 5 Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan, add the lamb steak and cook on both sides until cooked to taste. 6 Use a mandolin to cut one potato into thin spaghetti strands and cook in a pan of boiling water until tender. Heat the cream in a pan and simmer rapidly until thickened. Add the mustard and season. 7 Grate the other potato and place in a bowl. Add the icing sugar, season and mix together. 8 Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan, add the grated potato and flatten down. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer the cooked potato rosti onto a board and use a plain cutter to cut out circles. 9 Drain the potato spaghetti, add to the cream and stir to coat. Heat the butter in a wok, add the spinach and cook quickly to wilt. Strain the lamb strips through a sieve and reserve the sauce. 10 Arrange the potato discs on a plate, sit the spinach on top and add the potato spaghetti. Sit the lamb steak on top and drizzle the red wine sauce around the edge of the plate. 11 For the Onion Fritters: Fill a deep pan one third full with vegetable oil and heat. Place the self raising flour in a bowl with 2 tbsp chopped coriander and gradually add enough beer to make a thick batter. Pull the remaining onion wedges into pieces 2-3 layers thick, coat in the batter and deep fry. 12 Cut the orange into quarters, place in a mini food processor and blitz. Pour the orange into a pan, add the honey, sesame oil, soy sauce and 1/4 tbsp chopped coriander, heat through and season. Arrange the onion fritters on a plate, pour the sauce into a small pot and serve. NOTES : Chef - James Martin with Alice Beer"

In a medium saucepan, combine the 1/2 cup of sugar with 1/3 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring, over high heat. Meanwhile, combine the chocolates and the butter in a medium bowl. When the sugar mixture boils, pour it over the chocolates and stir until blended. Set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine the 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar and the eggs. Using a mixer set at high speed, whip the eggs and sugar until the mixture falls back onto itself in a slowly dissolving ribbon-like pattern when the beater is lifted. Add 1/3 of the egg mixture to the chocolate mixture and fold in with a spatula to lighten. Fold in the remaining egg mixture. Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Spray 6 (6-ounce) ramekins or 6 (2- by 3-inch) loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray and place them in a roasting pan just large enough to hold them. Divide the batter among the ramekins, place the roasting pan in the oven, and add enough water to the pan to come three-quarters of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the middle of the cakes comes out with just a few crumbs sticking to it, about 30 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. For the Sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the chocolate and cream and heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is melted. Cool for at least 30 minutes. For the Cream: Bring cream and almonds to a boil and store refrigerated for 24 hours. Strain, add vanilla and whip. For Plating: Dust plates with cocoa. Invert the ramekins onto the plates and add a scoop of the almond cream to each. Drizzle the chocolate over the cake and cream, sprinkle with chocolate curls, if using, and serve.

Whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the chocolate mixture. Pour into a greased and lined 23cm (9 1/2 inch) cake tin or a heart shaped tin or other shaped mould...try to keep it simple though as this is a moist cake. Bake in a bain marie in the oven at 140C/250F for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until done when tested with a toothpick...it will not test completely dry though. Leave to relax with the oven door ajar for another hour. The cake will rise like a souffle but will settle as there is no flour. Turn out when cold and dust with icing (confectioner's) sugar if desired. Serve with fresh unsweetened heavy cream, berries and a chocolate sauce or icecream. NB: For this cake to turn out well, use a good German, Belgian or Swiss bittersweet chocolate (preferably one with at least 60% cocoa solids). Also, I have not given an exact amount of sugar in this recipe...it depends on the type of chocolate you use (less sugar if you use semisweet chocolate for example) and how sweet you like the cake to be. I don't usually measure the sugar but I don't use much as it is much nicer if the flavour is intensely chocolate and not overly sweet."

Combine the wet ingredients with the dry until smooth. Place the mixture in the top of a double boiler and stir constantly until thick and glossy, about 7-10 minutes. Remove from the heat, place in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer for about 5 minutes on medium speed to avoid any lumps. Immediately cover with plastic wrap laid right on top of the frosting so that no air touches it. Allow to cool to room temperature. Trim the top of the cake and spread a thin layer of frosting over one of the cakes. Place a layer of raspberries or other fruit on top, top with the second layer, inverted, and frost the entire cake with the remaining frosting. Chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before slicing. NOTES: Andrew Sutton, Executive Chef of one of the Wine Country's most elegant resorts, Auberge du Soleil, contributes a quite extraordinary dessert to this article. He recommends that the cake is best if made a day in advance, wrapped tightly, and set in the refrigerator. : WWW - \"The Egg\" "

Peel the onions, quarter them and slice thickly. Wipe the chicken inside and out with a cloth wrung out in boiling water. Cut into 10 serving pieces: 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings and 2 breasts halved. Season each piece on both sides. Melt the butter in a sauteuse or large frying pan over low heat and when foaming add the chicken and colour to the golden stage on both sides. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, cover and keep hot. Add the onions to the fats in the pan, season, increase the heat to medium, mix well and colour to the golden stage, moving them around with a wooden spatula to prevent sticking and colouring too fast. Sprinkle with half the flour and mix in thoroughly before adding the remainder. Cook for a few moments, stirring constantly, reduce the heat to low, add the vinegar, stir well and arrange the chicken on top. Cover and cook slowly for about 40 minutes until the chicken is tender and the moisture from the onions has made the sauce. During this time shake the pan frequently and do not lift the lid except to stir the ingredients twice. Correct the seasoning if necessary and serve very hot with plain boiled potatoes.

Dredge the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour to coat on all sides. Shake off the excess flour. 2) Pour enough vegetable oil into a heavy deep skillet (cast-iron is perfect) to fill it to 2 inches. Heat over medium heat to 375oF. (A small cube of bread dropped in the dropped in the oil will brown in about 20 seconds.) 3) Add only as many of the chicken pieces as will fit without touching. Overcrowding will lower the temperature of the oil and make your fried chicken greasy. With a long-handled fork or tongs to prevent getting splattered, turn the chicken pieces until they are golden brown on all sides and cooked through, about 6 minutes. The easiest way to tell if the chicken is cooked is to poke a fork down to the bone near the thickest part - if the chicken is cooked the juices will run clear, not pink. 4) Remove the chicken pieces from the skillet to drain. If you have to fry the chicken in batches, keep the fried chicken warm on a baking sheet in a 250F oven. When all the chicken is fried, sprinkle the pieces with paprika and serve hot.

Whisk in the chicken stock, stirring to scrape up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Then stir in the milk and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve immediately, passing the gravy separately."

                "instructions": "This one is kinda unusual as it calls for frying up joined legs and thighs then cutting them into one inch bone-in slices after cooking. This is usually done with whole birds and I don't see why you couldn't use a whole chicken in this recipe. You'll need a Chinese cleaver or a hefty chef's knife for the chopping. Three of the contributing chefs who created original recipes for the book are Japanese. I understand that Chinese food is the favorite 'gaijin' cuisine in Japan and Chinese places abound. Just an interesting tidbit... 1. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; rub to coat evenly. Place chicken in non aluminum baking pan. Pound 2 onions and the sliced ginger root lightly with flat side of cleaver; chop coarsely and scatter over chicken. Sprinkle chicken with rice wine. Marinate at room temperature, turning chicken once, for 30 minutes. 2. Arrange lettuce on large serving platter. Refrigerate covered. 3. Mix sugar, vinegar, stock, soy sauce and sesame oil in small saucepan. Stir in minced onion, ginger and parsley. 4. Whisk egg white in small bowl until foamy and double in volume. Whisk in 2 tablespoons cornstarch. Reserve batter. 5. Heat wok over high heat for 20 seconds; add vegetable oil and heat to 350F. 6. Meanwhile, drain chicken; discard marinade. Pat chicken dry with paper toweling; dust with 2 tablespoons cornstarch. Spread batter on areas of chicken not covered with skin, coating evenly. 7. Fry 2 chicken pieces at a time, turning once, until crispy and cooked through, 7 to 9 minutes. (To test for doneness, pierce thickest part of drumstick to the bone with tip of knife; juices should run clear.) Drain chicken on paper toweling, keep warm in a 200F oven. Repeat, frying remaining 2 chicken pieces. 8. Heat stock mixture over medium heat to simmering. Reduce heat to low; simmer for 1 minute. Keep dressing hot. 9. Cut warm chicken into 1/2-inch wide slices; use a meat mallet or hammer to pound cleaver or sturdy chef's knife through bones. Reassemble chicken slices and place on bed of lettuce. Pour hot dressing over chicken. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings."

Perfect for an outdoor barbecue, this recipe can be doubled and tripled indefinitely. The wings are simple to put together, and have the good grace to get better as they sit in their marinade. In fact, if you can marinate them for 2 to 3 days -- but no longer, in the refrigerator -- they will be fantastic."

Cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes or marinate overnight in a ziptop bag. While the chicken marinates (or 30 minutes before you are ready to bake) soak the bamboo skewers in water to keep them from burning in the oven. 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Assemble skewers with a piece of chicken and half a fig. Stand skewers up in a casserole dish; spoon the marinade over the chicken and sprinkle with brown sugar. 3. Bake until the sugar topping turns into a golden brown crust and the chicken is white in color throughout, about 40-50 minutes. Serve while hot. Note: This upbeat chicken preparation gains its flavors from both the marinade and the brown sugar topping. Served in bite sized portions, this is a terrific sweet and savory item for parties.

Fill each muffin cup 2/3 full of batter. Bake the muffins for about 30 minutes, until the are golden brown and spring back when touched. Variation: To make spice muffins, stir 1/2 ts cinnamon, 1/4 ts ground ginger, and 1/8 ts cloves into the soy flour before adding to the egg yolks.
