Some of his most famous sayings include: 'Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.', 'It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.', and 'We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.' These quotes encapsulate Aristotle’s views on knowledge, education, and ethics, showcasing his profound influence on Western philosophy and thought."
