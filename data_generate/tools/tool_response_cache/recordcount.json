Experimental Design: An automated sample preparation and analysis system for enumerating CTCs (Celltracks) was adapted for detecting IGF-1R positive CTCs with a diagnostic antibody targeting a different IGF-1R epitope to CP-751,871. This assay was utilized in three phase I trials of CP-751,871 as a single agent or with chemotherapy and was validated using cell lines and blood samples from healthy volunteers and patients with metastatic carcinoma. Results: There was no interference between the analytical and therapeutic antibodies. CP-751,871 was well tolerated as a single agent, and in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel, at doses ranging from 0.05 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. Eighty patients were enrolled on phase 1 studies of CP-751,871, with 47 (59%) patients having CTCs detected during the study. Prior to treatment 26 patients (33%) had CTCs, with 23 having detectable IGF-1R positive CTCs. CP-751,871 alone, and CP-751,871 with cytotoxic chemotherapy, decreased CTCs and IGF-1R positive CTCs; these increased towards the end of the 21-day cycle in some patients, falling again with retreatment. CTCs were commonest in advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer (11/20). Detectable IGF-1R expression on CTCs before treatment with CP-751,871 and docetaxel was associated with a higher frequency of PSA declin"
