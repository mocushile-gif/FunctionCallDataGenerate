Given the input {'is_id': '1'}, it aims to fetch data specific to the user with ID 1. This could include details such as the user's name, email, profile details, and other relevant information associated with their account. Due to the nature of the provided input and example, explicit user details cannot be given, but this response is indicative of the type of data typically returned by such an API call, ensuring that the user's information is accurately obtained from a database or data source using the ID as a key for query."
