            "riddle": "Dorothy attended her family reunion last summer, but she reported an odd incident during the festivities. She was watching a group of adults and a group of children competing against one another in a race of about 30 yards. Dorothy was surprised to see a child win the race, but Dorothy also noted she was unable to see any of the participant's legs during the race. Dorothy has excellent vision, and her mental faculties are intact, but neither she nor any of the other spectators were able to see any sign of the racer's legs during the brief competition. Since none of the racers were amputees, and Dorothy wasn't imagining things, what do you suppose was the cause of her inability to see any of the racer\u2019s legs during the race?",
            "answer": "The adults and children were participating in a sack race at the family reunion.",
