Sarchasm: the gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the recipient who doesn't get it.  Contratemps: the resentment permanent workers feel toward the fill-in workers.  Reintarnation: coming back to life as a hillbilly.  Hipatitis: terminal coolness.  Dopeler effect: the tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come at you rapidly.  Foreploy: any misrepresentation about yourself for the purpose of obtaining sex.  Intaxication: euphoria at getting a refund from the IRS, which lasts until you realize it was your money to start with.",
