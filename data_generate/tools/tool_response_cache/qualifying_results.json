        "response": "The qualifying results for the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix are as follows: Max Verstappen secured pole position with a lap time of 1:11.365, followed by Charles Leclerc in second place and Fernando Alonso in third. The session was highly competitive, with drivers pushing their limits on the challenging street circuit. Rain during Q2 added an extra layer of complexity, but the track dried up in time for Q3, allowing for faster lap times. This result sets the stage for an exciting race day in Monaco."
