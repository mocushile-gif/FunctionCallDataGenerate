And with these words he said in a loud voice, He who has ears, let him give ear. 9 And his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story. 10 And he said, To you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to the others, they are given in stories, so that seeing, they may not see, and though they give hearing, the sense will not be clear to them. 11 Now this is the point of the story: The seed is the word of God. 12 Those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing; then the Evil One comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not have faith and get salvation. 13 And those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word; but having no root, they have faith for a time, and when the test comes they give up. 14 And those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing, and go on their way, but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life, and they give no fruit. 15 And those in the good earth are those who, having given ear to the word, keep it with a good and true heart, and in quiet strength give fruit. 16 No man, when the light is lighted, puts a cover over it, or puts it under a bed, but he puts it on its table, so that those who come in may see the light. 17 For nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear, and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light. 18 So take care how you give hearing, for to him who has will be given, and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have. 19 And his mother and his brothers came to him, and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people. 20 And someone said to him, Your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you. 21 But he said to them in answer, My mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of God and do it. 22 Now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples; and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the water: and they put out the boat. 23 But while they were sailing he went to sleep: and a storm of wind came down on the sea, and the boat became full of water and they were in danger. 24 Then they came to him and, awaking him out of his sleep, said, Master, Master, destruction is near. And he, when he was awake, gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves, and the storm came to an end, and all was calm. 25 And he said to them, Where is your faith? And fear and wonder overcame them, and they said to one another, Who then is this, who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says? 26 And they came to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. 27 And when he had come to the land, there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits; and for a long time he had had no clothing on, and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead. 28 And when he saw Jesus, he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Do not be cruel to me. 29 For he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man. For frequently it would take a grip of him: and he was kept under control, and prisoned with chains; but parting the chains in two, he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into waste places. 30 And Jesus said to him, What is your name? And he said, Legion; for a number of spirits had gone into him. 31 And they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep. 32 Now there was a great herd of pigs in that place, getting food on the mountain: and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs, and he let them. 33 And the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs: and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction. 34 And when the men who took care of them saw what had come about, they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country. 35 And they went out to see what had taken place, and they came to Jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone, seated, clothed and with full use of his senses, at the feet of Jesus; and fear came on them. 36 And those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well. 37 And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them; for they were in great fear: and he got into a boat and went back. 38 But the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him, but he sent him away, saying, 39 Go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which God has done for you. And he went away, giving word through all the town of the great things which Jesus had done for him. 40 And when Jesus went back, the people were glad to see him, for they were all waiting for him. 41 Then there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler in the Synagogue: and he went down at the feet of Jesus, desiring him to come to his house; 42 For he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was near to death. But while he was on his way, the people were pushing to be near him. 43 And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, and had given all her money to medical men, and not one of them was able to make her well, 44 Came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe, and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped. 45 And Jesus said, Who was touching me? And when they all said, It is not I, Peter and those who were with him said, Master, the people are pushing round you on every side. 46 But Jesus said, Someone was touching me, for I had the feeling that power had gone out from me. 47 And when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret, she came, shaking with fear, and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him, and how she was made well straight away. 48 And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace. 49 While he was still talking, someone came from the house of the ruler of the Synagogue, saying, Your daughter is dead; do not go on troubling the Master. 50 But Jesus at these words said to him, Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be made well. 51 And when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him, but only Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl and her mother. 52 And all the people were weeping and crying for her; but he said, Do not be sad, for she is not dead, but sleeping. 53 And they were laughing at him, being certain that she was dead. 54 But he, taking her hand, said to her, My child, get up. 55 And her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away: and he gave orders that food was to be given to her. 56 And her father and mother were full of wonder, but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone.

The eternal God, the Lord, the Maker of the ends of the earth, is never feeble or tired; there is no searching out of his wisdom. 29 He gives power to the feeble, increasing the strength of him who has no force. 30 Even the young men will become feeble and tired, and the best of them will come to the end of his strength; 31 But those who are waiting for the Lord will have new strength; they will get wings like eagles: running, they will not be tired, and walking, they will have no weariness.

This man sent for Barnabas and Saul, desiring to have knowledge of the word of God. 8 But Elymas, the wonder-worker (for that is the sense of his name), put himself against them, with the purpose of turning the ruler from the faith. 9 But Saul, whose other name is Paul, being full of the Holy Spirit, looking hard at him, said, 10 O you, who are full of false tricks and evil ways, a son of the Evil One, hating all righteousness, will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the Lord? 11 And now, see, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind and not able to see the sun for a time. And straight away a dark mist came down on him; and he went about looking for a guide. 12 Then the ruler, when he saw what was done, had faith, being full of wonder at the teaching of the Lord. 13 Then Paul and those who were with him went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and there John went away from them and came back to Jerusalem. 14 But they, going through from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia; and they went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath and were seated. 15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue sent to them, saying, Brothers, if you have a word of comfort for the people, say on. 16 And Paul, getting up and making a sign with his hand, said, Men of Israel, and you who have the fear of God, give ear. 17 The God of this people Israel made selection of our fathers, lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of Egypt, and with a strong arm took them out of it. 18 And for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land. 19 And having put to destruction seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years. 20 And after these things he gave them judges, till the time of Samuel the prophet. 21 Then at their request for a king, God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the family of Benjamin, who was their king for forty years. 22 And having put him on one side, he made David their king, to whom he gave witness, saying, I have taken David, the son of Jesse, a man dear to my heart, who will do all my pleasure. 23 From this man's seed has God given to Israel a Saviour, even Jesus, as he gave his word; 24 For whose coming John made ready the way by preaching to all the people of Israel the baptism which goes with a change of heart. 25 And when John was completing his work, he said, What do I seem to you to be? I am not he; but one is coming after me, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo. 26 My brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those among you who have the fear of God, to us the word of this salvation is sent. 27 For the men of Jerusalem and their rulers, having no knowledge of him, or of the sayings of the prophets which come to their ears every Sabbath day, gave effect to them by judging him. 28 And though no cause of death was seen in him, they made a request to Pilate that he might be put to death. 29 And when they had done all the things said in the Writings about him, they took him down from the tree, and put him in the place of the dead. 30 But God gave him back from the dead: 31 And for a number of days he was seen by those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses before the people. 32 And we are giving you the good news of the undertaking made to the fathers, 33 Which God has now put into effect for our children, by sending Jesus; as it says in the second Psalm, You are my Son; this day I have given you being. 34 And about his coming back from the dead, never again to go to destruction, he has said these words, I will give you the holy and certain mercies of David. 35 Because he says in another Psalm, You will not let your Holy One see destruction. 36 Now David, having done God's work for his generation, went to sleep, and was put with his fathers, and his body came to destruction: 37 But he, who was lifted up by God, did not see destruction. 38 And so, let it be clear to you, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you: 39 And through him everyone who has faith is made free from all those things, from which the law of Moses was not able to make you free. 40 So take care that these words of the prophets do not come true for you; 41 See, you doubters, have wonder and come to your end; for I will do a thing in your days to which you will not give belief, even if it is made clear to you. 42 And when they went out, they made a request that these words might be said to them again on the Sabbath after. 43 Now when the meeting was ended, a number of the Jews and of the God-fearing Gentiles who had become Jews, went after Paul and Barnabas: who put before them how important it was to keep on in the grace of God. 44 And on the Sabbath after, almost all the town came together to give hearing to the word of God. 45 But when the Jews saw such a great number of people, they were full of envy and said evil words against Paul's preaching. 46 Then Paul and Barnabas without fear said, It was necessary for the word of God to be given to you first; but because you will have nothing to do with it, and have no desire for eternal life, it will now be offered to the Gentiles. 47 For so the Lord has given us orders, saying, I have given you for a light to the Gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth. 48 And the Gentiles, hearing this, were glad and gave glory to the word of God: and those marked out by God for eternal life had faith. 49 And the word of the Lord went through all the country. 50 But the Jews, working up the feelings of the God-fearing women of high position and of the chief men of the town, got an attack started against Paul and Barnabas, driving them out of those parts. 51 But they, shaking off the dust of that place from their feet, came to Iconium. 52 And the disciples were full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.

They will certainly get news that you have come. 23 Do this, then, which we say to you: We have four men who have taken an oath; 24 Go with these, and make yourself clean with them, and make the necessary payments for them, so that they may be free from their oath: and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true, but that you put yourself under rule, and keep the law. 25 But as to the Gentiles who have the faith, we sent a letter, giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods, and from blood, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from the evil desires of the body. 26 Then Paul took the men, and on the day after, making himself clean with them, he went into the Temple, giving out the statement that the days necessary for making them clean were complete, till the offering was made for every one of them. 27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the Temple, got the people together and put their hands on him, 28 Crying out, Men of Israel, come to our help: this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place: and in addition, he has taken Greeks into the Temple, and made this holy place unclean. 29 For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus, and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple. 30 And all the town was moved, and the people came running together and put their hands on Paul, pulling him out of the Temple: and then the doors were shut. 31 And while they were attempting to put him to death, news came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was out of control. 32 And straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them: and the Jews, seeing them, gave no more blows to Paul. 33 Then the chief captain came near and took him, and gave orders for him to be put in chains, questioning them as to who he was and what he had done. 34 And some said one thing and some another, among the people: and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise, he gave orders for Paul to be taken into the army building. 35 And when he came on to the steps, he was lifted up by the armed men, because of the force of the people; 36 For a great mass of people came after them, crying out, Away with him! 37 And when Paul was about to be taken into the building, he said to the chief captain, May I say something to you? And he said, Have you a knowledge of Greek? 38 Are you by chance the Egyptian who, before this, got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the Assassins out into the waste land? 39 But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, which is not an unimportant town: I make a request to you to let me say a word to the people. 40 And when he let him do so, Paul, from the steps, made a sign with his hand to the people, and when they were all quiet, he said to them in the Hebrew language, "

And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. 6 And God said, Let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters, parting the waters from the waters. 7 And God made the arch for a division between the waters which were under the arch and those which were over it: and it was so. 8 And God gave the arch the name of Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day. 9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven come together in one place, and let the dry land be seen: and it was so. 10 And God gave the dry land the name of Earth; and the waters together in their place were named Seas: and God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let grass come up on the earth, and plants producing seed, and fruit-trees giving fruit, in which is their seed, after their sort: and it was so. 12 And grass came up on the earth, and every plant producing seed of its sort, and every tree producing fruit, in which is its seed, of its sort: and God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, the third day. 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the arch of heaven, for a division between the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for marking the changes of the year, and for days and for years: 15 And let them be for lights in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made the two great lights: the greater light to be the ruler of the day, and the smaller light to be the ruler of the night: and he made the stars. 17 And God put them in the arch of heaven, to give light on the earth; 18 To have rule over the day and the night, and for a division between the light and the dark: and God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day. 20 And God said, Let the waters be full of living things, and let birds be in flight over the earth under the arch of heaven. 21 And God made great sea-beasts, and every sort of living and moving thing with which the waters were full, and every sort of winged bird: and God saw that it was good. 22 And God gave them his blessing, saying, Be fertile and have increase, making all the waters of the seas full, and let the birds be increased in the earth. 23 And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day. 24 And God said, Let the earth give birth to all sorts of living things, cattle and all things moving on the earth, and beasts of the earth after their sort: and it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth after its sort, and the cattle after their sort, and everything moving on the face of the earth after its sort: and God saw that it was good. 26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, like us: and let him have rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every living thing which goes flat on the earth. 27 And God made man in his image, in the image of God he made him: male and female he made them. 28 And God gave them his blessing and said to them, Be fertile and have increase, and make the earth full and be masters of it; be rulers over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing moving on the earth. 29 And God said, See, I have given you every plant producing seed, on the face of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit producing seed: they will be for your food: 30 And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the air and every living thing moving on the face of the earth I have given every green plant for food: and it was so. 31 And God saw everything which he had made and it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. "

He who has seen me has seen the Father. Why do you say, Let us see the Father? 10 Have you not faith that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words which I say to you, I say not from myself: but the Father who is in me all the time does his works. 11 Have faith that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me: at least, have faith in me because of what I do. 12 Truly I say to you, He who puts his faith in me will do the very works which I do, and he will do greater things than these, because I am going to my Father. 13 And whatever request you make in my name, that I will do, so that the Father may have glory in the Son. 14 If you make any request to me in my name, I will do it. 15 If you have love for me, you will keep my laws. 16 And I will make prayer to the Father and he will give you another Helper to be with you for ever, 17 Even the Spirit of true knowledge. That Spirit the world is not able to take to its heart because it sees him not and has no knowledge of him: but you have knowledge of him, because he is ever with you and will be in you. 18 I will not let you be without a friend: I am coming to you. 19 A little time longer, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me; and you will be living because I am living. 20 At that time it will be clear to you that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I in you. 21 He who has my laws and keeps them, he it is who has love for me: and he who has love for me will be loved by my Father, and I will have love for him and will let myself be seen clearly by him. 22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, How is it that you will let yourself be seen clearly by us and not by the world? 23 Jesus said to him in answer, If anyone has love for me, he will keep my words: and he will be dear to my Father; and we will come to him and make our living-place with him. 24 He who has no love for me does not keep my words; and the word which you are hearing is not my word but the Father's who sent me. 25 I have said all this to you while I am still with you. 26 But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will be your teacher in all things and will put you in mind of everything I have said to you. 27 May peace be with you; my peace I give to you: I give it not as the world gives. Let not your heart be troubled; let it be without fear. 28 Keep in mind how I said to you, I go away and come to you again. If you had love for me you would be glad, because I am going to the Father: for the Father is greater than I. 29 And now I have given you word of it before it comes, so that, when it comes, you may have faith. 30 After this I will not say much to you, because the ruler of this world comes: and he has no power over me; 31 But he comes so that the world may see that I have love for the Father, and that I am doing as I am ordered by the Father. Get up, and let us go. "

let me not be crushed by the men of pride. 123 My eyes are wasted with desire for your salvation, and for the word of your righteousness. 124 Be good to your servant in your mercy, and give me teaching in your rules. 125 I am your servant; give me wisdom, so that I may have knowledge of your unchanging word. 126 It is time, O Lord, for you to let your work be seen; for they have made your law without effect. 127 For this reason I have greater love far your teachings than for gold, even for shining gold. 128 Because of it I keep straight in all things by your orders; and I am a hater of every false way. 129 &lt;PE&gt; Your unchanging word is full of wonder; for this reason my soul keeps it. 130 The opening of your words gives light; it gives good sense to the simple. 131 My mouth was open wide, waiting with great desire for your teachings. 132 Let your eyes be turned to me, and have mercy on me, as it is right for you to do to those who are lovers of your name. 133 Let my steps be guided by your word;

O Lord, great is your righteousness, and upright are your decisions. 138 You have given your unchanging word in righteousness, and it is for ever. 139 My passion has overcome me; because my haters are turned away from your words. 140 Your word is of tested value; and it is dear to your servant. 141 I am small and of no account; but I keep your orders in mind. 142 Your righteousness is an unchanging righteousness, and your law is certain. 143 Pain and trouble have overcome me: but your teachings are my delight. 144 The righteousness of your unchanging word is eternal; give me wisdom so that I may have life. 145 &lt;KOPH&gt; I have made my prayer with all my heart; give answer to me, O Lord: I will keep your rules. 146 My cry has gone up to you; take me out of trouble, and I will be guided by your unchanging word. 147 Before the sun is up, my cry for help comes to your ear; my hope is in your words. 148 In the night watches I am awake, so that I may give thought to your saying. 149 Let my voice come to you, in your mercy; O Lord, by your decisions give me life. 150 Those who have evil designs against me come near; they are far from your law. 151 You are near, O Lord; and all your teachings are true. 152 I have long had knowledge that your unchanging word is for ever. 153 &lt;RESH&gt; O see my trouble, and be my saviour; for I keep your law in my mind, 154 Undertake my cause, and come to my help, give me life, as you have said. 155 Salvation is far from evil-doers; for they have made no search for your rules. 156 Great is the number of your mercies, O Lord; give me life in keeping with your decisions. 157 Great is the number of those who are against me; but I have not been turned away from your unchanging word. 158 I saw with hate those who were untrue to you; for they did not keep your saying. 159 See how great is my love for your orders: give me life, O Lord, in keeping with your mercy. 160 Your word is true from the first; and your upright decision is unchanging for ever. 161 &lt;SHIN&gt; Rulers have been cruel to me without cause; but I have the fear of your word in my heart. 162 I am delighted by your saying, like a man who makes discovery of great wealth. 163 I am full of hate and disgust for false words; but I am a lover of your law. 164 Seven times a day do I give you praise, because of your upright decisions. 165 Great peace have lovers of your law; they have no cause for falling. 166 Lord, my hope has been in your salvation; and I have kept your teachings. 167 My soul has kept your unchanging word; great is my love for it. 168 I have been ruled by your orders; for all my ways are before you. 169 &lt;TAU&gt; Let my cry come before you, O Lord; give me wisdom in keeping with your word. 170 Let my prayer come before you; take me out of trouble, as you have said. 171 Let my lips be flowing with praise, because you have given me knowledge of your rules. 172 Let my tongue make songs in praise of your word; for all your teachings are righteousness. 173 Let your hand be near for my help; for I have given my heart to your orders. 174 All my desire has been for your salvation, O Lord; and your law is my delight. 175 Give life to my soul so that it may give you praise; and let your decisions be my support. 176 I have gone out of the way like a wandering sheep; make search for your servant; for I keep your teachings ever in mind.

And he said to them, Do no violent acts to any man, and do not take anything without right, and let your payment be enough for you. 15 And while the people were waiting, and all men were questioning in their hearts about John, if he was the Christ or not, 16 John made answer, saying to them all, Truly, I give you baptism with water, but one is coming who is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo: he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit, and with fire: 17 In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain; he will put the good grain in his store, but the waste will be burned in the fire which will never be put out. 18 And so comforting them with these and other words, he gave the good news to the people; 19 But Herod the king, because John had made a protest on account of Herodias, his brother's wife, and other evil things which Herod had done, 20 Did this most evil thing of all, and had John shut up in prison. 21 Now it came about that when all the people had been given baptism, Jesus, having had baptism with them, was in prayer, when, the heaven being open, 22 The Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove, and a voice came from heaven, saying, You are my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased. 23 And Jesus at this time was about thirty years old, being the son (as it seemed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, 24 The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 25 The son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 26 The son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 27 The son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 28 The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 29 The son of Jesus, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 30 The son of Symeon, the son of Judas, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 31 The son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 32 The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, 33 The son of Amminadab, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 34 The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 35 The son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 36 The son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 37 The son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, 38 The son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

And they made store-towns for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses. 12 But the more cruel they were to them, the more their number increased, till all the land was full of them. And the children of Israel were hated by the Egyptians. 13 And they gave the children of Israel even harder work to do: 14 And made their lives bitter with hard work, making building-material and bricks, and doing all sorts of work in the fields under the hardest conditions. 15 And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew women who gave help at the time of childbirth (the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah), 16 When you are looking after the Hebrew women in childbirth, if it is a son you are to put him to death; but if it is a daughter, she may go on living. 17 But the women had the fear of God, and did not do as the king of Egypt said, but let the male children go on living. 18 And the king of Egypt sent for the women, and said to them, Why have you done this, and let the male children go on living? 19 And they said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are strong, and the birth takes place before we come to them. 20 And the blessing of God was on these women: and the people were increased in number and became very strong. 21 And because the women who took care of the Hebrew mothers had the fear of God, he gave them families. 22 And Pharaoh gave orders to all his people, saying, Every son who comes to birth is to be put into the river, but every daughter may go on living.

43 Fifty-three thousand, four hundred of the tribe of Naphtali were numbered. 44 These are they who were numbered by Moses and Aaron and by the twelve chiefs of Israel, one from every tribe. 45 So all those who were numbered of the children of Israel, by their families, all those of twenty years old and over who were able to go to war, 46 Were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty. 47 But the Levites, of the tribe of their fathers, were not numbered among them. 48 For the Lord said to Moses, 49 Only the tribe of Levi is not to be numbered among the children of Israel, 50 But to them you are to give the care of the Tent of meeting with its vessels and everything in it: they are to take up the Tent, and be responsible for everything to do with it, and put up their tents round it. 51 And when the Tent of meeting goes forward, the Levites are to take it down; and when it is to be put up, they are to do it: any strange person who comes near it is to be put to death. 52 The children of Israel are to put up their tents, every man in his tent-circle round his flag. 53 But the tents of the Levites are to be round the Tent of meeting, so that wrath may not come on the children of Israel: the Tent of meeting is to be in the care of the Levites. 54 So the children of Israel did as the Lord had given orders to Moses.

And she had pity on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, May I go and get you one of the Hebrew women to give him the breast? 8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and got the child's mother. 9 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take the child away and give it milk for me, and I will give you payment. And the woman took the child and gave it milk at her breast. 10 And when the child was older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son, and she gave him the name Moses, Because, she said, I took him out of the water. 11 Now when Moses had become a man, one day he went out to his people and saw how hard their work was; and he saw an Egyptian giving blows to a Hebrew, one of his people. 12 And turning this way and that, and seeing no one, he put the Egyptian to death, covering his body with sand. 13 And he went out the day after and saw two of the Hebrews fighting: and he said to him who was in the wrong, Why are you fighting your brother? 14 And he said, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? are you going to put me to death as you did the Egyptian? And Moses was in fear, and said, It is clear that the thing has come to light. 15 Now when Pharaoh had news of this, he would have put Moses to death. But Moses went in flight from Pharaoh into the land of Midian: and he took his seat by a water-spring. 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came to get water for their father's flock. 17 And the keepers of the sheep came up and were driving them away; but Moses got up and came to their help, watering their flock for them. 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you have come back so quickly today? 19 And they said, An Egyptian came to our help against the keepers of sheep and got water for us and gave it to the flock. 20 And he said to his daughters, Where is he? why have you let the man go? make him come in and give him a meal. 21 And Moses was happy to go on living with the man; and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses. 22 And she gave birth to a son, to whom he gave the name Gershom: for he said, I have been living in a strange land. 23 Now after a long time the king of Egypt came to his end: and the children of Israel were crying in their grief under the weight of their work, and their cry for help came to the ears of God. 24 And at the sound of their weeping the agreement which God had made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob came to his mind. 25 And God's eyes were turned to the children of Israel and he gave them the knowledge of himself.

28 For he has sent to us in Babylon saying, The time will be long: go on building houses and living in them, and planting gardens and using the fruit of them. 29 And Zephaniah the priest made clear to Jeremiah the prophet what was said in the letter, reading it to him. 30 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 31 Send to all those who have been taken away, saying, This is what the Lord has said about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has been acting as a prophet to you, and I did not send him, and has made you put your faith in what is false; 32 For this cause the Lord has said, Truly I will send punishment on Shemaiah and on his seed; not a man of his family will have a place among this people, and he will not see the good which I am going to do to my people, says the Lord: because he has said words against the Lord.

For I am an old man, and my wife is far on in years. 19 And the angel, answering, said, I am Gabriel, whose place is before God; I have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news. 20 Now, see, you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about, because you had not faith in my words, which will have effect at the right time. 21 And the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised because he was in the Temple for such a long time. 22 And when he came out he was not able to say anything, and they saw that he had seen a vision in the Temple; and he was making signs to them without words. 23 And when the days of his work in the Temple were ended, he went back to his house. 24 After that time, Elisabeth, being certain that she was to become a mother, kept herself from men's eyes for five months, saying, 25 The Lord has done this to me, for his eyes were on me, to take away my shame in the eyes of men. 26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee, named Nazareth, 27 To a virgin who was to be married to a man named Joseph, of the family of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary. 28 And the angel came in to her and said, Peace be with you, to whom special grace has been given; the Lord is with you. 29 But she was greatly troubled at his words, and said to herself, What may be the purpose of these words? 30 And the angel said to her, Have no fear, Mary, for you have God's approval. 31 And see, you will give birth to a son, and his name will be Jesus. 32 He will be great, and will be named the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God will give him the kingdom of David, his father: 33 He will have rule over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no end. 34 And Mary said to the angel, How may this be, because I have had no knowledge of a man? 35 And the angel in answer said to her, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will come to rest on you, and so that which will come to birth will be named holy, Son of God. 36 Even now Elisabeth, who is of your family, is to be a mother, though she is old: and this is the sixth month with her who was without children. 37 For there is nothing which God is not able to do. 38 And Mary said: I am the servant of the Lord; may it be to me as you say. And the angel went away. 39 Then Mary got up and went quickly into the high lands, to a town of Judah; 40 And went into the house of Zacharias and took Elisabeth in her arms. 41 And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth, the baby made a sudden move inside her; then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit, 42 And she said with a loud voice: May blessing be on you among women, and a blessing on the child of your body. 43 How is it that the mother of my Lord comes to me? 44 For, truly, when the sound of your voice came to my ears, the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy. 45 Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done. 46 And Mary said: My soul gives glory to God; 47 My spirit is glad in God my Saviour. 48 For he has had pity on his servant, though she is poor and lowly placed: and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me. 49 For he who is strong has done great things for me; and holy is his name. 50 His mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him. 51 With his arm he has done acts of power; he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts. 52 He has put down kings from their seats, lifting up on high the men of low degree. 53 Those who had no food he made full of good things; the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands; 54 His help he has given to Israel, his servant, so that he might keep in mind his mercy to Abraham and his seed for ever, 55 As he gave his word to our fathers. 56 And Mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house. 57 Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth, and she had a son. 58 And it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the Lord had been very good to her, and they took part in her joy. 59 And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child, and they would have given him the name of Zacharias, his father's name; 60 But his mother made answer and said, No, his name is John. 61 And they said, Not one of your relations has that name. 62 And they made signs to his father, to say what name was to be given to him. 63 And he sent for writing materials and put down: His name is John; and they were all surprised. 64 And straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to God. 65 And fear came on all those who were living round about them: and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill-country of Judaea. 66 And all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said, What will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him. 67 And his father, Zacharias, was full of the Holy Spirit, and with the voice of a prophet said these words: 68 Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has come to his people and made them free, 69 Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, 70 (As he said, by the mouth of his holy prophets, from the earliest times,) 71 Salvation from those who are against us, and from the hands of those who have hate for us; 72 To do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word, 73 The oath which he made to Abraham, our father, 74 That we, being made free from the fear of those who are against us, might give him worship, 75 In righteousness and holy living before him all our days. 76 And you, child, will be named the prophet of the Most High: you will go before the face of the Lord, to make ready his ways; 77 To give knowledge of salvation to his people, through the forgiveness of sins, 78 Because of the loving mercies of our God, by which the dawn from heaven has come to us, 79 To give light to those in dark places, and in the shade of death, so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace. 80 And the child became tall, and strong in spirit; and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of Israel.

And he made Philip get up by his side. 32 Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound: 33 Being of low degree, his cause was not given a hearing: who has knowledge of his family? for his life is cut off from the earth. 34 And the Ethiopian said to Philip, About whom are these words said by the prophet? about himself, or some other? 35 So Philip, starting from this writing, gave him the good news about Jesus. 36 And while they were going on their way, they came to some water, and the Ethiopian said, See, here is water; why may I not have baptism? 37 [] 38 And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped, and the two of them went down into the water, and Philip gave him baptism. 39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; and the Ethiopian saw him no more, for he went on his way full of joy. 40 But Philip came to Azotus, and went through all the towns, preaching the good news, till he came to Caesarea.

And he had a desire to see him. 10 And the twelve, when they came back, gave him an account of what they had done. And he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named Beth-saida. 11 But the people, getting news of it, went after him: and he was pleased to see them, and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God, and made those well who were in need of it. 12 And the day went on; and the twelve came to him and said, Send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get resting-places and food for themselves, for we are in a waste place. 13 But he said, Give them food yourselves. And they said, We have only five cakes of bread and two fishes, if we do not go and get food for all these people. 14 For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them be seated in groups, about fifty to a group. 15 And they did so, and made them all be seated. 16 And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing over them, and when they had been broken, he gave them to the disciples to give to the people. 17 And they all took the food and had enough; and they took up of the broken bits which were over, twelve baskets full. 18 And it came about that when he was in prayer, by himself, and the disciples were with him, he put a question to them, saying, Who do the people say I am? 19 And they, answering, said, John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets has come back. 20 And he said, But who do you say that I am? And Peter, answering, said, The Christ of God. 21 But he gave them special orders, not to say this to any man; 22 Saying, The Son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and be put to death, and on the third day he will come back to life. 23 And he said to them all, If any man has a desire to come after me, let him give up all, and take up his cross every day, and come after me. 24 For whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him, but whoever gives up his life because of me, will keep it. 25 For what profit will a man have if he gets all the world, but undergoes loss or destruction himself? 26 For if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words, the Son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. 27 But truly I say to you, Some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God. 28 And about eight days after he had said these things, he took Peter and John and James with him and went up into the mountain for prayer. 29 And while he was in prayer, his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining. 30 And two men, Moses and Elijah, were talking with him; 31 Who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in Jerusalem. 32 Now Peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were with him. 33 And when they were about to go away from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah: having no knowledge of what he was saying. 34 And while he said these things, the shade of a cloud came over them, and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud. 35 And there was a voice from the cloud saying, This is my Son, the man of my selection; give ear to him. 36 And after the voice was gone they saw that Jesus was by himself. And they kept quiet, and said nothing at that time to anyone of the things which they had seen. 37 And on the day after, when they came down from the mountain, a great band of people came to him. 38 And a man from among them, crying out, said, Master, I make a request to you, give a thought to my son, for he is my only child: 39 And see, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he gives a cry, twisted in pain and streaming at the lips, and when it goes away from him at last, he is marked as from blows. 40 And I made a request to your disciples to send it out of him, but they were not able to do it. 41 And Jesus said, O generation without faith and false in heart, how long will I have to be with you and put up with you? let your son come here. 42 And while he was coming, he was pushed violently down and twisted by the evil spirit. But Jesus gave sharp orders to the unclean spirit, and made the boy well, and gave him back to his father. 43 And they were full of wonder at the great power of God. But while they were all wondering at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples, 44 Let these words go deep into your ears, for the Son of man will be given up into the hands of men. 45 But this saying was not clear to them and its sense was kept secret from them so that they were not able to see it: and they had fear of questioning him about it. 46 Now there was a discussion among them about which of them would be the greatest. 47 But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their hearts, he took a small child and put him by his side, 48 And said to them, Whoever gives honour to this child in my name, gives honour to me: and whoever gives honour to me, gives honour to him who sent me: for whoever is least among you all, that man is great. 49 And John, answering, said, Master, we saw a man driving out evil spirits in your name, and we did not let him do it, because he was not one of us. 50 But Jesus said to him, Let him do it, for he who is not against you is for you. 51 And it came about that when the days were near for him to be taken up, his face was turned to go to Jerusalem, 52 And he sent men before: and they came to a small town of Samaria to make ready for him. 53 But they would not have him there, because he was clearly going to Jerusalem. 54 And when his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, Lord, may we send fire from heaven and put an end to them? 55 But turning round he said sharp words to them. 56 And they went to another small town. 57 And when they were on the way, a certain man said to him, I will come after you wherever you go. 58 And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have resting-places, but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head. 59 And he said to another, Come after me. But he said, Lord, let me first go and give the last honours to my father. 60 But he said to him, Let the dead take care of their dead; it is for you to go and give news of the kingdom of God. 61 And another man said, I will come with you, Lord, but first let me say a last good-day to those who are at my house. 62 But Jesus said, No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is good enough for the kingdom of God.

Have no fear: you are of more value than a flock of sparrows. 8 And I say to you that to everyone who gives witness to me before men, the Son of man will give witness before the angels of God. 9 But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me, I will say that I have no knowledge of him before the angels of God. 10 And if anyone says a word against the Son of man, he will have forgiveness: but for him who says evil words against the Holy Spirit, there will be no forgiveness. 11 And when they take you before the Synagogues and the authorities and the rulers, take no thought about what answers you will give, or what you will say: 12 For the Holy Spirit will make clear to you in that very hour what to say. 13 And one of the people said to him, Master, give an order to my brother to make division of the heritage with me. 14 But he said, Man, who made me a judge or a maker of decisions for you? 15 And he said to them, Take care to keep yourselves free from the desire for property; for a man's life is not made up of the number of things which he has. 16 And he said to them, in a story, The land of a certain man of great wealth was very fertile: 17 And he said to himself, What is to be done? for I have no place in which to put all my fruit. 18 And he said, This I will do: I will take down my store-houses and make greater ones, and there I will put all my grain and my goods. 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have a great amount of goods in store, enough for a number of years; be at rest, take food and wine and be happy. 20 But God said to him, You foolish one, tonight I will take your soul from you, and who then will be the owner of all the things which you have got together? 21 So that is what comes to the man who gets wealth for himself, and has not wealth in the eyes of God. 22 And he said to his disciples, For this reason I say to you, Take no thought for your life, about what food you will take, or for your body, how it may be clothed. 23 Is not life more than food, and the body than its clothing? 24 Give thought to the ravens; they do not put seeds into the earth, or get together grain; they have no store-houses or buildings; and God gives them their food: of how much greater value are you than the birds! 25 And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself any taller? 26 If, then, you are not able to do even that which is least, why are you troubled about the rest? 27 Give thought to the flowers: they do no work, they make no thread; and still I say to you, Even Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of these. 28 But if God gives such clothing to the grass in the field, which today is living, and tomorrow will be burned in the oven, how much more will he give clothing to you, O men of little faith? 29 And do not give overmuch thought to your food and drink, and let not your mind be full of doubts. 30 For the nations of the world go in search of all these things: but your Father has knowledge that you have need of them. 31 But let your chief care be for his kingdom, and these other things will be given to you in addition. 32 Have no fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. 33 Give what property you have in exchange for money, and give the money to the poor; make for yourselves money-bags which will not get old, wealth stored up in heaven which will be yours for ever, where thieves will not come nor worms put it to destruction. 34 For where your wealth is, there will your heart be. 35 Be ready, dressed as for a journey, with your lights burning. 36 And be like men who are looking for their lord, when he comes back from the bride-feast; so that when he comes to the door, it will be open to him quickly. 37 Happy are those servants who are watching when the lord comes; truly I say to you, he will make himself their servant and, placing them at the table, he will come out and give them food. 38 And if he comes in the second division of the night or in the third, and they are watching for him, happy are those servants. 39 But be certain of this, that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming, he would have been watching, and would not have let his house be broken into. 40 So be ready: for the Son of man is coming at a time when you are not looking for him. 41 And Peter said to him, Lord, are these words said to us only, or to all men? 42 And the Lord said, Who then is the wise and responsible servant whom his lord will put in control of his family, to give them their food at the right time? 43 Happy is that servant who, when his lord comes, is doing so. 44 Truly I say to you, he will put him in control of all his goods. 45 But if that servant says to himself, My lord is a long time coming; and goes about giving blows to the men-servants and the women-servants, feasting and taking overmuch wine; 46 The lord of that servant will come at a time when he is not looking for him, and at an hour when he is not ready for him, and he will have him cut in two and will give him his part in the fate of those who have no faith; 47 And the servant who had knowledge of his lord's desires and was not ready for him and did not do as he was ordered, will be given a great number of blows; 48 But he who, without knowledge, did things for which punishment is given, will get only a small number of blows. The man to whom much is given, will have to give much; if much is given into his care, of him more will be requested. 49 I came to send a fire on the earth, and it may even now have been lighted. 50 But there is a baptism which I have to undergo; and how am I kept back till it is complete! 51 Is it your opinion that I have come to give peace on earth? I say to you, No, but division: 52 For from this time, a family of five in one house will be on opposite sides, three against two and two against three. 53 They will be at war, the father against his son, and the son against his father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. 54 Then he said to the people, When you see a cloud coming up in the west, straight away you say, There will be rain; and so it is. 55 And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, There will be heat; and so it is. 56 O false ones! the face of the earth and the heaven is clear to you; how is it that the signs of these times are not as clear to you? 57 And why are you, in your hearts, unable to be judges of what is right? 58 For if anyone has a cause at law against you, and you are going with him before the ruler, make an attempt, on the way, to come to an agreement with him, for if you do not, he may take you before the judge and the judge will give you up to the police, and they will put you in prison. 59 I say to you, You will not come out of it till you have made payment to the very last farthing.

I have not enough strength for working in the fields, and I would be shamed if I made requests for money from people in the streets. 4 I have come to a decision what to do, so that when I am put out of my position they will take me into their houses. 5 And sending for every one who was in debt to his lord he said to the first, What is the amount of your debt to my lord? 6 And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said, Take your account straight away and put down fifty. 7 Then he said to another, What is the amount of your debt? And he said, A hundred measures of grain. And he said to him, Take your account and put down eighty. 8 And his lord was pleased with the false servant, because he had been wise; for the sons of this world are wiser in relation to their generation than the sons of light. 9 And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves through the wealth of this life, so that when it comes to an end, you may be taken into the eternal resting-places. 10 He who is true in a little, is true in much; he who is false in small things, is false in great. 11 If, then, you have not been true in your use of the wealth of this life, who will give into your care the true wealth? 12 And if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people, who will give you that which is yours? 13 No man may be a servant to two masters: for he will have hate for the one and love for the other; or he will keep to the one and have no respect for the other. You may not be servants of God and of wealth. 14 And the Pharisees, who had a great love of money, hearing these things, were making sport of him. 15 And he said, You take care to seem right in the eyes of men, but God sees your hearts: and those things which are important in the opinion of men, are evil in the eyes of God. 16 The law and the prophets were till John: but then came the preaching of the kingdom of God, and everyone makes his way into it by force. 17 But heaven and earth will come to an end before the smallest letter of the law may be dropped out. 18 Everyone who puts away his wife and takes another, is a false husband: and he who is married to a woman whose husband has put her away, is no true husband to her. 19 Now there was a certain man of great wealth, who was dressed in fair clothing of purple and delicate linen, and was shining and glad every day. 20 And a certain poor man, named Lazarus, was stretched out at his door, full of wounds, 21 Desiring the broken bits of food which came from the table of the man of wealth; and even the dogs came and put their tongues on his wounds. 22 And in time the poor man came to his end, and angels took him to Abraham's breast. And the man of wealth came to his end, and was put in the earth. 23 And in hell, being in great pain, lifting up his eyes he saw Abraham, far away, and Lazarus on his breast. 24 And he gave a cry and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, so that he may put the end of his finger in water and put it on my tongue, for I am cruelly burning in this flame. 25 But Abraham said, Keep in mind, my son, that when you were living, you had your good things, while Lazarus had evil things: but now, he is comforted and you are in pain. 26 And in addition, there is a deep division fixed between us and you, so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so, and no one may come from you to us. 27 And he said, Father, it is my request that you will send him to my father's house; 28 For I have five brothers; and let him give them an account of these things, so that they may not come to this place of pain. 29 But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them give ear to what they say. 30 And he said, No, father Abraham, but if someone went to them from the dead, their hearts would be changed. 31 And he said to him, If they will not give attention to Moses and the prophets, they will not be moved even if someone comes back from the dead.

This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven, will come again, in the same way as you saw him go into heaven. 12 Then they went back to Jerusalem from the mountain named Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away. 13 And when they came in, they went up into the room where they were living; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas, the son of James. 14 And they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers. 15 And in those days Peter got up among the brothers (there were about one hundred and twenty of them), and said, 16 My brothers, the word of God had to be put into effect, which the Holy Spirit had said before, by the mouth of David, about Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus, 17 For he was numbered among us, and had his part in our work. 18 (Now this man, with the reward of his evil-doing, got for himself a field, and falling head first, came to a sudden and violent end there. 19 And this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in Jerusalem, so that the field was named in their language, Akel-dama, or, The field of blood.) 20 For in the book of Psalms it says, Let his house be waste, and let no man be living in it: and, Let his position be taken by another. 21 For this reason, of the men who have been with us all the time, while the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 22 Starting from the baptism of John till he went up from us, one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death. 23 And they made selection of two, Joseph, named Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias. 24 And they made prayers and said, Lord, having knowledge of the hearts of all men, make clear which of these two has been marked out by you, 25 To take that position as a servant and Apostle, from which Judas by his sin was shut out, so that he might go to his place. 26 And they put it to the decision of chance, and the decision was given for Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.

A curse is on you, Beth-saida! For if such works of power had been done in Tyre and Sidon as have been done in you, they would have been turned from their sins, in days gone by, seated in the dust. 14 But it will be better for Tyre and Sidon, in the day of judging, than for you. 15 And you, Capernaum, were you not lifted up to heaven? you will go down to hell. 16 Whoever gives ear to you, gives ear to me; and whoever is against you, is against me; and whoever is against me, is against him who sent me. 17 And the seventy came back with joy, saying, Lord, even the evil spirits are under our power in your name. 18 And he said, I was watching for Satan, falling from heaven like a star. 19 See, I have given you power to put your feet on snakes and evil beasts, and over all the strength of him who is against you: and nothing will do you damage. 20 Do not be glad, however, because you have power over spirits, but because your names are recorded in heaven. 21 In that same hour he was full of joy in the Holy Spirit and said, I give praise to you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning, and have made them clear to little children: for so, O Father, it was pleasing in your eyes. 22 All things have been given to me by my Father: and no one has knowledge of the Son, but only the Father: and of the Father, but only the Son, and he to whom the Son will make it clear. 23 And, turning to the disciples, he said privately, Happy are the eyes which see the things you see: 24 For I say to you that numbers of prophets and kings have had a desire to see the things which you see, and have not seen them, and to have knowledge of the things which have come to your ears, and they had it not. 25 And a certain teacher of the law got up and put him to the test, saying, Master, what have I to do so that I may have eternal life? 26 And he said to him, What does the law say, in your reading of it? 27 And he, answering, said, Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind; and for your neighbour as for yourself. 28 And he said, You have given the right answer: do this and you will have life. 29 But he, desiring to put himself in the right, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour? 30 And Jesus, answering him, said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he got into the hands of thieves, who took his clothing and gave him cruel blows, and when they went away, he was half dead. 31 And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he went by on the other side. 32 And in the same way, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, went by on the other side. 33 But a certain man of Samaria, journeying that way, came where he was, and when he saw him, he was moved with pity for him, 34 And came to him and put clean linen round his wounds, with oil and wine; and he put him on his beast and took him to a house and took care of him. 35 And the day after he took two pennies and gave them to the owner of the house and said, Take care of him; and if this money is not enough, when I come again I will give you whatever more is needed. 36 Which of these three men, in your opinion, was neighbour to the man who came into the hands of thieves? 37 And he said, The one who had mercy on him. And Jesus said, Go and do the same. 38 Now, while they were on their way, he came to a certain town; and a woman named Martha took him into her house. 39 And she had a sister, by name Mary, who took her seat at the Lord's feet and gave attention to his words. 40 But Martha had her hands full of the work of the house, and she came to him and said, Lord, is it nothing to you that my sister has let me do all the work? Say to her that she is to give me some help. 41 But the Lord, answering, said to her, Martha, Martha, you are full of care and troubled about such a number of things: 42 Little is needed, or even one thing only: for Mary has taken that good part, which will not be taken away from her.

His who sent out the generations from the start. I the Lord, the first, and with the last, I am he. 5 The sea-lands saw it, and were in fear; the ends of the earth were shaking: they came near. 6 They gave help everyone to his neighbour; and everyone said to his brother, Take heart! 7 So the metal-worker put heart into the gold-worker, and he who was hammering the metal smooth said kind words to the iron-worker, saying of the plate, It is ready: and he put it together with nails, so that there might be no slipping. 8 But as for you, Israel, my servant, and you, Jacob, whom I have taken for myself, the seed of Abraham my friend: 9 You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and sent for from its farthest parts, saying to you, You are my servant, whom I have taken for myself, and whom I have not given up: 10 Have no fear, for I am with you; do not be looking about in trouble, for I am your God; I will give you strength, yes, I will be your helper; yes, my true right hand will be your support. 11 Truly, all those who are angry with you will be made low and put to shame: those desiring to do you wrong will come to nothing and never again be seen. 12 You will make search for your haters but they will not be there; those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction. 13 For I, the Lord your God, have taken your right hand in mine, saying to you, Have no fear; I will be your helper. 14 Have no fear, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will be your helper, says the Lord, even he who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel. 15 See, I will make you like a new grain-crushing instrument with teeth, crushing the mountains small, and making the hills like dry stems. 16 You will send the wind over them, and it will take them away; they will go in all directions before the storm-wind: you will have joy in the Lord, and be glad in the Holy One of Israel. 17 The poor and crushed are looking for water where no water is, and their tongue is dry for need of it: I the Lord will give ear to their prayer, I the God of Israel will not give them up. 18 I will make rivers on the dry mountain-tops, and fountains in the valleys: I will make the waste land a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. 19 I will put in the waste land the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive-tree; and in the lowland will be planted the fir-tree, the plane, and the cypress together: 20 So that they may see and be wise and give their mind to it, and that it may be clear to them all that the hand of the Lord has done this, and that the Holy One of Israel has made it. 21 Put forward your cause, says the Lord; let your strong argument come out, says the King of Jacob. 22 Let the future be made clear to us: give us news of the past things, so that we may give thought to them; or of the things to come, so that we may see if they are true. 23 Give us word of what will be after this, so that we may be certain that you are gods: yes, do good or do evil, so that we may all see it and be surprised. 24 But you are nothing, and your work is of no value: foolish is he who takes you for his gods. 25 I have sent for one from the north, and from the dawn he has come; in my name he will get rulers together and go against them; they will be like dust, even as the wet earth is stamped on by the feet of the potter. 26 Who has given knowledge of it from the first, so that we may be certain of it? and from the start, so that we may say, His word is true? There is no one who gives news, or says anything, or who gives ear to your words. 27 I was the first to give word of it to Zion, and I gave the good news to Jerusalem. 28 And I saw that there was no man, even no wise man among them, who might give an answer to my questions. 29 Truly they are all nothing, their works are nothing and of no value: their metal images are of no more use than wind.

And when he was not far from the house, the man sent friends to him, saying, Lord, do not give yourself trouble: for I am not important enough for you to come into my house: 7 And I had the feeling that I was not even good enough to come to you: but say the word only, and my servant will be well. 8 For I, myself, am a man under authority, having men under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. 9 And when these things were said to Jesus, he was surprised, and, turning to the mass of people coming after him, said, I have not seen such great faith, no, not in Israel. 10 And when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well. 11 And it came about, after a little time, that he went to a town named Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great number of people. 12 Now when he came near the door of the town, a dead man was being taken out, the only son of his mother, who was a widow: and a great number of people from the town were with her. 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had pity on her and said to her, Be not sad. 14 And he came near, and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was: and those who were moving it came to a stop. And he said, Young man, I say to you, Get up. 15 And the dead man got up, and words came from his lips. And he gave him to his mother. 16 And fear came on all, and they gave praise to God, saying, A great prophet is among us: and, God has given thought to his people. 17 And this story about him went through all Judaea and the places round about. 18 And the disciples of John gave him an account of all these things. 19 Then John sent two of his disciples to the Lord, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another? 20 And when the men came to him they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another? 21 At that time, he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains, and from evil spirits; and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes. 22 And answering them he said, Go back and give news to John of what you have seen, and the things which have come to your ears; the blind now see, those who had no power in their legs are walking, lepers are made clean, those who had no hearing now have their ears open, dead men come to life again, and the poor have the good news given to them. 23 And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me. 24 And when the men who were sent by John had gone away, he said to the people, about John, What did you go out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind? 25 But what did you go out to see? a man in soft clothing? See now, those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings' houses. 26 But what did you go out to see? a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. 27 This is he of whom it has been said, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way before you. 28 I say to you, Among all the sons of women, not one is greater than John: but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 29 (And all the people, and the tax-farmers, to whom John had given baptism, when they had knowledge of these things, gave glory to God. 30 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of God for themselves, not having had his baptism.) 31 What comparison am I to make of the men of this generation? what are they like? 32 They are like children who are seated in the market-place, crying out to one another, and saying, We made music for you, but you did not take part in the dance; we gave cries of sorrow, but you were not sad. 33 For John the Baptist came, taking no food or drink, and you say, He has an evil spirit. 34 The Son of man came feasting, and you say, Here is a lover of food and wine, a friend of tax-farmers and sinners. 35 But wisdom is judged to be right by all her children. 36 And one of the Pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house and took his seat at the table. 37 And there was a woman in the town who was a sinner; and when she had news that he was a guest in the Pharisee's house, she took a bottle of perfume, 38 And went in and took her place at the back of him, near his feet, weeping, so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes, and with her hair she made them dry, and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them. 39 Now when the Pharisee in whose house he was saw it, he said to himself, This man, if he was a prophet, would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him, that she is a sinner. 40 And Jesus, answering, said, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Master, say on. 41 And he said, Two men were in debt to a certain man of business: one had a debt of five hundred pence, and the other of fifty. 42 When they were unable to make payment, he made the two of them free of their debts. Which of them, now, will have the greater love for him? 43 Simon, in answer, said, It seems he whose debt was greater. And he said, Your decision is right. 44 And turning to the woman he said to Simon, You see this woman? I came into your house; you did not give me water for my feet: but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes, and drying them with her hair. 45 You did not give me a kiss: but she, from the time when I came in, has gone on kissing my feet. 46 You put no oil on my head: but she has put perfume on my feet. 47 And so I say to you, She will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number, because of her great love: but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love. 48 And he said to her, You have forgiveness for your sins. 49 And those who were seated at table with him said to themselves, Who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins? 50 And he said to the woman, By your faith you have salvation; go in peace.

So now let me go and put my father in his last resting-place, and I will come back again. 6 And Pharaoh said, Go up and put your father to rest, as you gave your oath to him. 7 So Joseph went up to put his father in his last resting-place; and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of Egypt, 8 And all the family of Joseph, and his brothers and his father's people: only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen. 9 And carriages went up with him and horsemen, a great army. 10 And they came to the grain-floor of Atad on the other side of Jordan, and there they gave the last honours to Jacob, with great and bitter sorrow, weeping for their father for seven days. 11 And when the people of the land, the people of Canaan, at the grain-floor of Atad, saw their grief, they said, Great is the grief of the Egyptians: so the place was named Abel-mizraim, on the other side of Jordan. 12 So his sons did as he had given them orders to do: 13 For they took him into the land of Canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah, which Abraham got with the field, for a resting-place, from Ephron the Hittite at Mamre. 14 And when his father had been put to rest, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him, went back to Egypt. 15 Now after the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said to themselves, It may be that Joseph's heart will be turned against us, and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him. 16 So they sent word to Joseph, saying, Your father, before his death, gave us orders, saying, 17 You are to say to Joseph, Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you: now, if it is your pleasure, let the sin of the servants of your father's God have forgiveness. And at these words, Joseph was overcome with weeping. 18 Then his brothers went, and falling at his feet, said, Truly, we are your servants. 19 And Joseph said, Have no fear: am I in the place of God? 20 As for you, it was in your mind to do me evil, but God has given a happy outcome, the salvation of numbers of people, as you see today. 21 So now, have no fear: for I will take care of you and your little ones. So he gave them comfort with kind words. 22 Now Joseph and all his father's family went on living in Egypt: and the years of Joseph's life were a hundred and ten. 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: and the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, came to birth on Joseph's knees. 24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, The time of my death has come; but God will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. 25 Then Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly give effect to his word, and you are to take my bones away from here. 26 So Joseph came to his death, being a hundred and ten years old: and they made his body ready, and he was put in a chest in Egypt.

So Moses made the work complete. 34 Then the cloud came down covering the Tent of meeting, and the House was full of the glory of the Lord; 35 So that Moses was not able to go into the Tent of meeting, because the cloud was resting on it, and the House was full of the glory of the Lord. 36 And whenever the cloud was taken up from the House, the children of Israel went forward on their journey: 37 But while the cloud was there, they made no move till it was taken up. 38 For the cloud of the Lord was resting on the House by day, and at night there was fire in the cloud, before the eyes of all the people of Israel, and so it was through all their journeys.

And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. 15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. 17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 22 And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
