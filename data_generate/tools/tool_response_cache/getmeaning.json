            "meaning": "An apple is a round fruit with red or green skin and a whitish inside. One variety of apple might be sweet, another sour.  The apple isn't just a fruit. It's a symbol — from the apples eaten by Adam and Eve in the Biblical creation story, which symbolize the loss of innocent to the expression \"American as apple pie\" to mean something that is wholesome. The \"apple of your eye\" is the person who delights you — maybe you are the apple of your grandfather's eye. He might tell you, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away,\" meaning the fruit is good for your health."

            "meaning": "The flat surface people sit around when they eat together is a table. A table can also be a chart full of information. When doing your taxes, you might use a tax table to determine how much you owe.  Table is a very common noun, but it can also be used as a verb. In American English, the verb table means to set a matter aside indefinitely. For example, if state senators can't come to a compromise about new zoning laws, they might simply decide to table the issue. Confusingly, British English uses the verb table in precisely the opposite way: if members of the English Parliament table a piece of legislation, they formally submit it for discussion or debate."

A person who is timid and shy can also be called a mouse. In computer terms, a mouse is a corded or wireless device that moves your computer's cursor while you move the mouse. In most cases, the plural of mouse is \"mice,\" but more than one computer mouse can also be called \"mouses.\" Mouse can also be a verb in this context, like when you mouse over an icon to select a link."

            "meaning": "You know that vast, wet expanse of blue that keeps crashing waves on the beach? That's the ocean.  Atlantic, Pacific, Indian...these are just a few of the big oceans of the world. If Columbus hadn't sailed the ocean blue in 14 hundred ninety-two, America would have never been discovered. Home to sharks, mermaids, sailboats, and tsunami waves, the ocean makes up most of the planet Earth. But you can use ocean to describe anything similarly vast and limitless, like an endless ocean of fans at a rock concert."

Some islands are so small that a beach chair and umbrella barely fit on them and some are big enough to contain a whole nation.  To get to an island you must take a boat, bridge or airplane — be a strong swimmer. If you can get there by land it’s not an island, though it may be a peninsula, like Florida. There are many famous islands, like Manhattan and the islands of Hawaii. Things that are free-standing can also be called islands, like the island made of cabinets and a counter that is found in some kitchens — it's not connected to anything else."

Also, “to moon” means to show your rear. The moon is out! Giggle giggle.  The earth has just one moon, but the word moon can mean any natural satellite of any planet. Astronomers have discovered many moons — there are more than 160 in our solar system alone. Poets have been fascinated by the moon for a long time, and \"to moon\" also means \"to act in a dreamy or aimless way.\" Our months are marked by changes in the moon's phase, and the Proto-Indo-European root means both \"moon\" and \"month.\""

From the Old English luflic “affectionate, loveable,” comes lovely, an adjective that describes a person’s or thing’s attractiveness. Find the word love in there — it's something so attractive you can't help but love it. Lovely can also refer to something delightful. For example, a pretty selection of cakes and pastries arranged on a doily could be described as lovely. Anything from your girlfriend to a fresh coat of red paint on your motorcycle can be lovely."

            "meaning": "A banana is a curved, yellow fruit with a thick skin and soft sweet flesh. If you eat a banana every day for breakfast, your roommate might nickname you \"the monkey.\"  A banana is a tropical fruit that's quite popular all over the world. It grows in bunches on a banana tree. To \"go bananas\" is a slangy way of saying \"go crazy\" or act ridiculous, and if someone refers to the \"top banana,\" they mean the most important person in a particular group. The origin of banana isn't certain, but it's thought that it was borrowed by the Spanish or Portuguese from an African word, probably the Wolof word banana."

Or, perhaps you are in a small cabin that is warm and dry as they rain pours down outside. Or you have just stumbled upon the judge of a writing contest having dinner with one of the aspiring novelists — cozy can also mean \"scheming.\" And as a noun? A cozy is a padded cloth used to keep a teapot warm."

In this case, someone is giving you difficult questions to see how much you know. Test more generally means \"trial.\" If you test a soap on your skin, you use it on one small patch, to see if you'll have an allergic reaction. A drug test looks for the presence of drugs in your system. A difficult time in life is sometimes called \"a test,\" because it's testing your strength to persevere."
