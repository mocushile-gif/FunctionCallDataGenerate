I want people to focus on what I\u2019m saying, not how well I can sing.\u201d \u2014Artist and songwriter @nemahsis (Nemahsis) \\n \\n\u201cBeing a Palestinian born and raised in Canada, there are traces of both the Arabic scale and the French pop that I grew up with. These two influences tend to blend in my sound. I always volunteer my identity as Palestinian, because being Muslim is obvious in my appearance wearing hijab, and many times it overpowers my existence. \\n \\nMy younger self always had a difficult time emotionally connecting to Eurocentric pop stars writing about heartbreak. There\u2019s so much privilege in heartbreak being the strongest pain you\u2019ve endured. No one was writing about the experiences millions of hijabi women go through daily. I created a solution to a problem. \\n \\nI felt as though I couldn\u2019t write popular music until I fulfilled the duties of honoring my younger self. So long as I tried my best to make a difference, I deserve to write fun music that more people can relate to. It\u2019s heavy creating conceptually freeing music \u2014 sometimes I just want to write a song that doesn\u2019t feel like a trauma dump. Honesty is all I strive for.\u201d \\n \\nPhotos by @nemahsis', 'type': 1, 'created_at': 1682524492, 'created_at_utc': 1682524492, 'content_type': 'comment', 'status': 'Active', 'bit_flags': 0, 'did_report_as_spam': False, 'share_enabled': False, 'user': {'has_anonymous_profile_picture': False, 'fan_club_info': {'fan_club_id': None, 'fan_club_name': None, 'is_fan_club_referral_eligible': None, 'fan_consideration_page_revamp_eligiblity': None, 'is_fan_club_gifting_eligible': None, 'subscriber_count': None, 'connected_member_c"
