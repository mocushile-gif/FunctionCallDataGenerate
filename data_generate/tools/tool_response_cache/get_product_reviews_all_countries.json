It‚Äôs all that she has worked towards since she was five years old. She managed to get a full scholarship, but her pairs partner wasn‚Äôt interested in furthering his career. So, as a freshman she was paired up with Aaron who was in the same boat.\n\nStasis comes to win and nothing will get in her way. She has a meticulous schedule, regime and diet that will not be put off track for anybody or anything. Until she gets summoned along with the entire sporting department for a mandatory meeting that disrupts her day. This disruption continues when they are informed that Rink Two, the Hockey Teams Ice, is out for the count and they all have to share one ice rink.\n\nNathan is the captain of the schools hockey team. He has never met a problem he couldn‚Äôt solve, that is until his ice rink is flooded and they have to share with the figure skating team. He sees Anastasia arguing with her coach after the meeting, and his attempt to smooth things over backfires in his face.\n\nAnastasia‚Äôs partner gets injured so Nathan steps in to fill the role. Swapping out a puck for a toe pick, the pair find themselves stuck together and closer than ever.\n\nReview:\n\nI don‚Äôt even know where to fully start here.\n\nThe premise is amazing and reminded me of the movie ‚ÄúThe Cutting Edge‚Äù. It‚Äôs a semi-accurate comparison but only in certain spots. I give this author credit though as she made it her own and it didn‚Äôt feel like a rip off of a timeless classic. I‚Äôm not even mad at the execution of the story, as it kept me hooked.\n\nOne complaint though is the spice level. It comes out of the gate swinging and while it does calm down after chapter two until a bit later in the book, this was just too much for my personal preference. Not to mention that the first sexual encounter between Anastasia and Nate left much to be desired. She just used the bathroom dude and you knelt‚Ä¶. Well. You get it. ü§Æ\n\nMy second complaint is the epilogue. It just wasn‚Äôt needed. I got to the last chapter of the book and thought I was done only for there to be a very predictable epilogue. I think the epilogue actually ruins the story and rushes achievements for the Main Couple. It felt out of place from what we learned through the book, like the author wanted it so it happened. The lady chapter would have been the perfect ending.\n\nOne thing I absolutely loved about this story was the cast of characters. It wasn‚Äôt just about the main duo, it included such lovable hockey players on Nathan‚Äôs team and an amazing best friend for Anastasia. The author managed to flush out these characters and give them their own personalities and problems. It really felt like I could be in a room with a group of friends.\n\nBanter is also my weakness. Coming in strong with not only enjoyable back and forth between Ana and Nate, the way the hockey team comes together and ribs on each other was so perfect. There were multiple spots outside of the main couple that had me laughing. The team even accepted Ana and Lola into their group and they joined in on the fun of driving Nate crazy.\n\nI have to say that the way the author really delved outside of the romance to introduce complex backstories and emotions for these characters was really well done. Anastasia is in therapy and we see how her anxiety and obsessive planning became established. We see how it affects her daily life and even those around her. It wasn‚Äôt just a throwaway plot point, the author actually disperses it throughout the story in a great way.\n\nWe also get to see some healing in regards to how Ana looks at food. This is such a delicate subject and I think it was handled so well. Of course, I‚Äôm coming at this from someone who has (luckily ‚Äî but no shame to anyone who hasn‚Äôt been so lucky ‚Äî I support you) never experienced trauma with food. I hope that the author truly did portray it in a healthy way and if not, can someone please educate me?\n\nThe climax of the story was pristine but there were some moments that had me rolling my eyes. Development that we worked through only for it to be torn down to further the plot. But, that‚Äôs the way the stories are written so what can you do?\n\nOverall there were some really great moments through the book but it wasn‚Äôt enough to overpower the ending. The ending really ruined it for me and unfortunately that‚Äôs a big ding taking away from the rating.",

She is a relationship-phobia but has a friend with benefits Ryan who she hooks up with until he starts liking someone and Stas meet Nate the captain of the hockey team. The hockey team's arena gets vandalized, and they have to share with the figure skaters, which causes problems, and there is an icebreaker that they all have to meet each other. Lola starts dating Robbie, who is Nate's BF and roommates, and Stas starts hooking up with Nate. Aaron gets injured and claims Nate did it, and it almost causes problems until Stas realizes she knows Nate and trust him, so her and Lola pretty much move into their house. For Christmas, Stas and Nate go to her parents in Washington for a couple of days, and they love Nate right away. Then they go to Colorado since Nate's Dad and sister are gone. While there, Stas goes skating on the lake alone and falls in, and thankfully, Nate saves her. After his Dad and sister come home early and his Dad actually likes Stas. They return to school where the problem continues. Aaron is released to skate again, and him and Stas start attending therapy together, and she moves back in. Nate finds out the Aaron was hurt by playing football drunk with UCLA friends, but he can't tell Stas because it's her competition weekend. After they compete, Aaron kisses Stas, which is the final straw. After getting their scores, Stas announced that she's going solo and goes back to Nate's house for good. Nate graduates and goes to Toronto for professional hockey and Stas finished college at Maple Hills and won goldfir women's solo in ice-skating. The book ends with Stas pregnant and them living in Seattle, where Nate plays now. On their baby-moon, Nate finally proposed. Spice level was a solid 3, somewhat 4.",

Do not let the cute cover fool you because this one is easily 5/5 üå∂Ô∏è\n\nI loved the plot line for Anastasia but I will say Nate‚Äôs own personal plot fell a bit short to accommodate for hers. Their journey was really cute but not without its own tension and healthy dose of push and pull. My biggest appreciation is the fact the book did not have a third act breakup! I don‚Äôt mind them but they do feel redundant so I appreciated how this book deviated from that!\n\nI was warned from the start not to read the epilogue but I‚Äôm stubborn myself and if you tell me not to do something‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna do it. I didn‚Äôt find it bad at all. Was it necessary? No? But if you love when your characters have everything wrapped up in a tidy red bow? Then you‚Äôll love it. It was a full on HEA moment. The ending of the book did feel a bit sudden before jumping to the epilogue but that‚Äôs my only real complaint.",

The character development, the banter, the tropes, the romance; chef's kiss 10/10. Nate has raised the standards for all men. This book focused on the 2 main characters Anastasia and Nate but the character building of all the side characters made me fall in love with all of them, especially Henry (can't wait for his book)! The next book Wildfire comes out in October and i can't wait for that release and to hear the story of Russ and Aurora. This was the perfect hockey romance that hits all the right spots. Made me giddy all the way through and had the perfect amount of spice!! Definitely deserves all the hype it gets!",

Nate's intro was perfection. To see him start there to where he finished, that's what we call growth ü§å Stassie at first I wasn't a huge fan of but she grew on me pretty quickly. Especially when they're forced to interact due to the hockey team and the figure skaters having to share a rink. The frenemies to lovers storyline has always been one of my favorites and I think it was done really well.\n\nIt felt a little longer than necessary at some parts but I think it all helped to tell and finish the complete story. And the epilogue actually got me choked up. I'm definitely curious to see what else Grace has in store for some of the other characters you get to know in Maple Hills.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend. It's a cute storyline with some heavy topics that were dealt with in what I think was a realistic way. The back and forth between Stassie and Nate was fun and the spice was ü•µ (and the dirty talk was next level. Stassie gave just as good as Nate and I love that with female characters.)",

Plus a few reeeeeally cliche lines (I‚Äôm looking at you ‚Äúreleasing a breath I didn‚Äôt know I was holding‚Äù).\n\nPlease do not take that as me being heartless and not seeing the absolute manipulative jerk that was Aaron in this whole thing. Because that had stakes on Anastasia and I adored her and wanted to protect her. I literally felt like Henry (who, by the way, needs his own book). But the sports and college side of this required a lot of suspension of disbelief that I could not quite give into from my own college athletic history. I get it. Sports romance are NOT EVEN CLOSE to accurately depicting real life college or pro athletics, and that is probably my personal experience coloring my enjoyment, but you gotta give me *something* at least partially accurate.\n\nUnfortunately, reading this did not give me any good sports material for a plot (seriously, a coach threatening to bench and forfeit his whole team? That could literally lose him his job. Believe me, he will care)(the other coach letting her kids skip class to practice? Against ncaa rules, my friend)(a student being the assistant coach and living with players and his bff? Also yikes)(missing 8+ weeks being suspended based on the other person‚Äôs injury? That is DETRIMENTAL to a career, and one that a college athlete should not take as lightly as he did for being so adamant about his future in the NHL). Anyway, the sports stakes outside the relationship sucked so I wasn‚Äôt invested when Anastasia and Nate weren‚Äôt on the page together.\n\nHowever, despite the 3‚≠êÔ∏è I was planning on giving, this jumped to a 4 for the healthy depiction of a relationship and the spice. Wow. 4üå∂Ô∏è/5 for me, and I am stingy about that. Their relationship and the benefits of said relationship were incredibly written and one of the most impressive depictions I‚Äôve seen in a romance book. I adore communication between couples and despite the hiccups, these two never stopped talking to one another. They were sweet and sexy and delicious.",

I did enjoy the relationship between Anastacia and Nathan when they werent only obsessed with how hot they were for each other ( I like steam in my romance books but so much of the steam in this book just felt like it was put in there to make the story longer and cause it seems like what's going viral is the influencer talking about \"how smutty\" a book is).

To me, it seemed like everything about the book was just a little too much in every way. Anastasia (Stassie) was too sassy and relationship-adverse while living a very regimented lifestyle as she was preparing to qualify for the Olympics someday in figure skating. She kept giving Nate the brush-off and this guy was so enamored with her that he kept coming back to try to win her over. It was too exhausting on his behalf for a guy who never had a girlfriend before and just seemed so sure about this. Then came all the side characters who completely embodied whatever personality they had and flexed it to the fullest where they were just too perfect at being whatever role they were subjected to. All in all, I loved Nate, but he was too cinnamon roll for me when it came to Stassie, but she definitely needed a guy to be supportive and protective. There are serious issues addressed and both characters exhibit growth and maturity as time goes on while they figure out how to be in a relationship. Although it took a while to get invested, I did like the direction of the story and the outcome and there are some cute parts with their friends as well as sweet scenes. However, even that was a little too perfect in the way it ended.",

                    "reviewContent": "Tropes/Key Points:\n‚ú®Sports/College Romance\n‚ú®Enemies to Lovers\n‚ú®Warped Love Triangleish\n‚ú®Dual POV\n\n3.5‚≠êÔ∏è\nüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è\n\nBlurb:\n\nAnastasia is a junior in college on track to be an Olympic Figure Skater. It‚Äôs all that she has worked towards since she was five years old. She managed to get a full scholarship, but her pairs partner wasn‚Äôt interested in furthering his career. So, as a freshman she was paired up with Aaron who was in the same boat.\n\nStasis comes to win and nothing will get in her way. She has a meticulous schedule, regime and diet that will not be put off track for anybody or anything. Until she gets summoned along with the entire sporting department for a mandatory meeting that disrupts her day. This disruption continues when they are informed that Rink Two, the Hockey Teams Ice, is out for the count and they all have to share one ice rink.\n\nNathan is the captain of the schools hockey team. He has never met a problem he couldn‚Äôt solve, that is until his ice rink is flooded and they have to share with the figure skating team. He sees Anastasia arguing with her coach after the meeting, and his attempt to smooth things over backfires in his face.\n\nAnastasia‚Äôs partner gets injured so Nathan steps in to fill the role. Swapping out a puck for a toe pick, the pair find themselves stuck together and closer than ever.\n\nReview:\n\nI don‚Äôt even know where to fully start here.\n\nThe premise is amazing and reminded me of the movie ‚ÄúThe Cutting Edge‚Äù. It‚Äôs a semi-accurate comparison but only in certain spots. I give this author credit though as she made it her own and it didn‚Äôt feel like a rip off of a timeless classic. I‚Äôm not even mad at the execution of the story, as it kept me hooked.\n\nOne complaint though is the spice level. It comes out of the gate swinging and while it does calm down after chapter two until a bit later in the book, this was just too much for my personal preference. Not to mention that the first sexual encounter between Anastasia and Nate left much to be desired. She just used the bathroom dude and you knelt‚Ä¶. Well. You get it. ü§Æ\n\nMy second complaint is the epilogue. It just wasn‚Äôt needed. I got to the last chapter of the book and thought I was done only for there to be a very predictable epilogue. I think the epilogue actually ruins the story and rushes achievements for the Main Couple. It felt out of place from what we learned through the book, like the author wanted it so it happened. The lady chapter would have been the perfect ending.\n\nOne thing I absolutely loved about this story was the cast of characters. It wasn‚Äôt just about the main duo, it included such lovable hockey players on Nathan‚Äôs team and an amazing best friend for Anastasia. The author managed to flush out these characters and give them their own personalities and problems. It really felt like I could be in a room with a group of friends.\n\nBanter is also my weakness. Coming in strong with not only enjoyable back and forth between Ana and Nate, the way the hockey team comes together and ribs on each other was so perfect. There were multiple spots outside of the main couple that had me laughing. The team even accepted Ana and Lola into their group and they joined in on the fun of driving Nate crazy.\n\nI have to say that the way the author really delved outside of the romance to introduce complex backstories and emotions for these characters was really well done. Anastasia is in therapy and we see how her anxiety and obsessive planning became established. We see how it affects her daily life and even those around her. It wasn‚Äôt just a throwaway plot point, the author actually disperses it throughout the story in a great way.\n\nWe also get to see some healing in regards to how Ana looks at food. This is such a delicate subject and I think it was handled so well. Of course, I‚Äôm coming at this from someone who has (luckily ‚Äî but no shame to anyone who hasn‚Äôt been so lucky ‚Äî I support you) never experienced trauma with food. I hope that the author truly did portray it in a healthy way and if not, can someone please educate me?\n\nThe climax of the story was pristine but there were some moments that had me rolling my eyes. Development that we worked through only for it to be torn down to further the plot. But, that‚Äôs the way the stories are written so what can you do?\n\nOverall there were some really great moments through the book but it wasn‚Äôt enough to overpower the ending. The ending really ruined it for me and unfortunately that‚Äôs a big ding taking away from the rating.",

I do see the positives in this book and I can see why some people really like it, but do I think its worth the hype? No, absolutely not. I think that this book is so popular right now because it does all the things the tiktok girlies love to promote. It's way too long (they love that), it's hockey (literally everyone is \"in their hockey era\"); but it's not even really hockey. This book is way more figure skating than hockey, I suppose you could say its angsty, the TT girlies love a possive hero and a tiny tiny firecracker herione and it's \"smutty\" (I literally hate the word smut when talking about these books. Like please TT girlies let's find a different word). This book is incredibly sex positive, huge on consent which I love and did have a fun group of side characters (but I will say there were a lot and I did confused about who was who in the beginning). I did enjoy the relationship between Anastacia and Nathan when they werent only obsessed with how hot they were for each other ( I like steam in my romance books but so much of the steam in this book just felt like it was put in there to make the story longer and cause it seems like what's going viral is the influencer talking about \"how smutty\" a book is). While there were things I like about this book and I will read the next one (I'm a series finisher)¬† ultimately I don't think this will be anything that sticks with me.\n\nTW: toxic relationship w/ food, wtf is up with the coach and her talking about Nathan's bulge and also the nastiness with the server?",

Perhaps a bar soap might be better. I don‚Äôt find this a fault of the brush but in small spaces like my shower it is easy to bang against the walls. It is likely easier to use in a regular shower or from a seated position. The length is though what I was looking for in a foot brush. It will clean your feet and between your toes.",

I find that that the bristles could have been softer and closer together especially if using a liquid body wash on the brush the product tends to sink down between the bristles. Perhaps a bar soap might be better. I don‚Äôt find this a fault of the brush but in small spaces like my shower it is easy to bang against the walls. It is likely easier to use in a regular shower or from a seated position. The length is though what I was looking for in a foot brush. It will clean your feet and between your toes.",

But I had to get a new power supply, but it needed to be an HP one. As far as I know I had the choice of 400 and 500 watt ones they make. The only one I could find was a 400 watt one. (Also I'm sure there's a converter somewhere in the world, but the HP ones fit the case) So with that, and on top of that I had to buy a graphics card. Which I chose an rtx 2060. With those both installed now. The PC runs how I wanted when I ordered it. VR works now, the games run at least at 57 FPS at 1080. That was the lowest it ran and that was Doom eternal. Halo infinite was in the 100s for frames. So 1080p gaming works just fine.\nIts decently fast at starting, I have no complaints at the moment. It would have been 5 stars if it all worked without the upgrading. But good to know for next time, just man up and build my own.",

If you also bought it, make sure to check your warranty expiration date per the HP Support Assistant app (it comes pinned in the taskbar if you haven't yet unpinned it). Mine was dated to expire as soon as May of 2023! I found out later that's because HP automatically starts the 1-year warranty based on when Amazon purchased these in bulk from HP. Fortunately HP provides a place to dispute your warranty (apparently this is a Known Issue) - I uploaded my proof of purchase, waited a few days, uploaded it again, waited a few more days. After a week of waiting, I called HP Support, and endured a long phone call while the agent finally updated my warranty expiration from May 2023 to October 2023. Never had this happen with any other product before.",

That being said, this brand (not this style) is also sold at Nordstrom for the same price points. You can at least know that it's a stylish label and you are not overpaying just because it's here on Amazon. I bought another dress by this designer from Nordstrom and it too is equally lovely.\nVery happy with my purchase and this is beautiful for all sorts of summer events.",

For me they roll at the waist and at times they‚Äôll roll at the thigh but overall these are great and come in such pretty colors and getting 3 for the price of 1 in some other brands is a big plus.

They are squat proof, even in the lighter colors and so far the only shorts I don‚Äôt have to worry about camel toe with. For me they roll at the waist and at times they‚Äôll roll at the thigh but overall these are great and come in such pretty colors and getting 3 for the price of 1 in some other brands is a big plus.

                    "reviewContent": "Cross Of Iron is a masterpiece, one of the greatest anti-war, anti-authoritarian movies. It is one of director Sam Peckinpah's two finest works -- the other being The Wild Bunch. It deserves to be ranked in the same great war movie company as Apocalypse Now, Das Boot, Full Metal Jacket, Paths Of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, Seven Samurai, and Zulu. Its setting on the World War Two Eastern Front, its gruesomeness, and its risk-taking viewpoint on ugly combat from the German side, have tended to count against fair assessment of its considerable artistic achievements. Viewers wary of the morality of its German viewpoint and its explicitness might find that it is fundamentally about humanity in general as a victim of war. The film reflects on the humanity which may be found on all sides of conflict--including Russian humanity portrayed variously as relentless, innocent, brave, and feminine.\n\nCross Of Iron opens with an intense, chilling montage of children's song, propaganda vision, combat newsreel and atrocity. By the end of the main title this montage subtly introduces the central characters, a German reconnaissance unit patrolling on the 1943 Russian front.\n\nThis 1977 film set rarely matched standards of cinematic mayhem. Cross Of Iron explosions don't look merely like pretty fireballs -- they blast fragments, rocks and debris, leaving no doubt as to why blood gouts from stumps of limbs and shrapnel-shredded entrails... Amid the screams of wounded and dying, as dust subsides from a mortar barrage, an artillery piece shorn of its crew by a near hit swings across a pocked battlefield, its traversing wheel spinning under its own momentum. The carnage occurs in the choreographed slow motion which Peckinpah made his signature.\n\nJames Coburn turns in one of his finest roles as Rolf Steiner, a highly decorated NCO who leads a German reconnaissance squad. Steiner fights less for his country than for his comrades. He has low opinions of class and rank distinctions. He is contemptuous both of Nazism and the aristocratic Prussian arrogance of his new superior officer, Captain Stransky, played with great style by Maximilian Schell. But there are hints of a dark side. Although Steiner is articulate and philosophical he has no answer when his love interest during an enforced break from battle, nurse Eva (Senta Berger), bitterly accuses him of being afraid of what he would be without the war.\n\nAmong the many fine supporting performances, James Mason plays the war-weary Colonel Brandt. He sees the immorality and futility of German war aims, but his sense of honour and duty about the prevailing struggle makes ceasing to fight unthinkable. David Warner plays Brandt's out-of-place and out-of-time adjutant, Captain Kiesel, who represents to his colonel the hope that a more enlightened postwar Germany might arise from the ashes of inevitable defeat.\n\nWar movie buffs irritated by the technical inaccuracies common in many examples of the genre will find some satisfaction in attention to authenticity of weaponry. A range of genuine WWII German and Russian small arms appears. The T 34/85 tanks are real, although the very picky might argue that this is at least six months premature, and that for the summer of '43 they should be T 34/76. Tactics at times deviate from the textbooks, but this is a drama, not a combat manual.\n\nCross Of Iron is a five-star movie. The Hen's Tooth Video release was a two-star DVD, with sub-standard picture and sound. It was worth owning only while this great film of a great American director lacked the high quality collectors' edition Zone 1 DVD release it deserves, or the far superior European DVD and Blu-ray releases it later received.\n\nUpdate in September 2011: It appears that only the DVD and Blu-ray releases of this film for the European market - notably those published by Studio Canal - are good quality transfers, as well as being in the original widescreen aspect ratio. Studio Canal's Blu-ray release (encoded for Region B only) is significantly better even than their DVD. It shows so much more detail compared to the DVD releases, for example, that the lettering and designs of German military awards like the Krim and Kuban Shield shoulder insignia can be seen clearly on screen, and wine and beer bottle labels are easily read. The Blu-ray is available from Amazon.co.uk, but can be played only on Region B-capable Blu-ray decks. Extras on this Blu-ray include a gem, a documentary by Mike Siegel called \"Passion & Poetry - Sam Peckinpah's War\". This gives fascinating insight into the making of \"Cross of Iron\" and Peckinpah's directorial style through contemporary and later interviews with James Coburn, David Warner, Senta Berger, Maximilian Schell, Roger Fritz, Vadim Glowna, Katy Haber and Peckinpah himself. It includes a shot of Peckinpah reminiscing proudly about receiving a telegram from Orson Welles saying it was 'one of the finest war films ever made'. Welles was so right.",

                    "reviewContent": "Overview\nCross of Iron is director Sam Peckinpah's look at the German Army on the Eastern Front in 1943. In this movie, Feldwebel Steiner (played by James Coburn) leads a Reconnaissance platoon (more like a squad) that has received a new company commander, Hauptmann Stransky who has arrived from a posting in France with the focus of winning the Iron Cross. To gain the Iron Cross Hauptmann Stransky is prepared to do whatever is necessary.\n\nThe Good\nThe characters are great. James Coburn is outstanding as the seasoned veteran leading his section and he does a great job in this role. Maximilian Schell is also good playing Hauptmann Stransky; he's everything we want to hate in an officer that focuses on himself and not his men. James Mason plays the regimental commander that is sympathetic to Steiner and does a good job in this role.\n\nThe action is fast and very nice. While bloody at times, it fits with how war movies should be and captures what I've read about the actions on the Eastern Front from history books.\n\nThe story takes place on the Crimean Peninsula and is woven around the actual battles that took place there in that timeframe. While the regiment is not directly mentioned, the dress and bearing is that of one of the many infantry regiments that would have fought there.\n\nShowing Russian women in service. For the time period this movie was made in that was something that many people in the West weren't aware of. Since that time it's become more common knowledge but this would have been one of the earlier references to it.\n\nI also loved the uniforms. Mr. Peckinpah didn't make the mistake of using later war camouflage uniforms or SS uniforms. Matter of fact, I love the fact that this is around a regular infantry unit rather than a SS or elite unit.\n\nThe Bad\nIgnoring the minor things (use of F4U's for Russian aircraft and T-34/85's vs T-34/76's), I have an issue with James Coburn's age when this was filmed. Coburn looks in his late 40's or early 50's. You don't expect a Feldwebel leading a recon platoon to be that old (it can happen though).\n\nI also had a problem with the fact that Hauptmann Stransky bounces in to get the Iron Cross and then is bouncing back to France. I'm sorry, at that point in the war that would be highly unlikely, even for a member of the former aristocracy. Something like that would have been more likely if Hauptmann Stransky had been assigned to Italy, but then we wouldn't have the story set in the Crimean.\n\nThe conflict between Feldwebel Steiner and Hauptmann Stransky was to close to a Vietnam thing. I won't say that German officers wouldn't lie to get something they wanted, I will say though that Steiner would have been very out of character for a Feldwebel and probably sentenced to a Penal Battalion.\n\nThe alcohol flows a little freely for a unit on the Eastern Front. If they were in France or Italy I could say yes, but there's a lot of it and it's not vodka they show (actually beer and wine).\n\nThe Rating\nA Solid 4.5 stars! The acting is solid, the story moves and has a purpose. I love the interplay between Steiner and Stransky. You see two men who are very different, one rich, one who's working class. I also love the camaraderie between Steiner and his men. This is something that occurs when people share tragic events and continue to live. There is a little sexual content and the battle scenes are a little graphic (for when the film was made. Since Amazon requires whole numbers, I'll have to give the nod to 4 stars because to much of the film reminded me of the strife between US officers and enlisted people in the early '70's rather than what we read about the German Army in 1943. A very good movie thought that I'll highly recommend.",

And the first time I watched 'Cross of Iron' I was kinda blown away. Are there flaws? Yes. But the film really captures a bit of the essence that was the Eastern front. The opening credits with footage and a children song playing in the background is great. The footage of Hitler, the Eastern Front, the cheering crowds is pretty overwhelming. One of my favorite opening credit sequences. The remarkable thing was that 'Cross of Iron' was accomplished with a budget of around 6 million dollars. In comparison from the same year, 'A Bridge Too Far', had a budget of 26 million dollars. 'Cross of Iron' truly has very good battle scenes including a very gripping sequence of a attack by Soviet T-34 tanks that is one of the highlights of the picture. Also, I love the detail of the scene with a water cooled machine gun. Really excellent military detail.\n\nThe film also has a scene that shows how death was so casual on the Eastern front where millions died. A dead German soldier has been ground into the road by trucks and other vehicles running over him and no one cares. This is a very strong but quick scene in the movie\n\nJames Coburn is very strong as Steiner and pretty much anchors the picture. Schell, Mason, and Warner are very good also. The uniforms and the equipment are pretty good representations and as mentioned before the scene where Steiner and his men try to hold off the T-34s seems to be a precursor to similar scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan.'\n\nThe Special Edition DVD while expensive is at least in the near proper aspect ratio and enhanced for widescreen TVs. It is a nice improvement over the previous DVD. The picture is good but the sound could be better. There is a informative commentary track by Stephen Prince who also did the commentary track for Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs'. The commentary track is quite good and manages to cover the real World War II history behind the film, differences with the novel, and the actual making of the film quite well. It is really worth a listen. The only other extras are viewable lobby cards and a hyperbolic trailer.\n\nFans should pick up the novel too by Willi Heinrich. It is interesting to compare the two and see how different they are.\n\nOne of my favorites films from one of my favorite directors! Highly recommended!\n\nThis ranks with my other favorite theatrical war films about WWII: 'A Bridge Too Far', 'Downfall', 'Stalingrad', 'Das Boot', 'Letters from Iwo Jima' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.",

The film benefits from strong performances of James Coburn and James Mason along with strong period detail and a compelling story. It isn‚Äôt his best movie but it remains a strong movie.\n\nOf course Peckinpah took a unique approach to the subject; his film focuses on German infantry men fighting during the Russian campaign. Steiner (Coburn) and his men struggle to survive in a foreign land. He finds his decisions called into question by his new commander (Maximillian Schell) who believes the propaganda about how invincible the Germans are and focuses only glory.\n\nHen‚Äôs Tooth releases this using the same transfer as the UK release except it is considerably more compressed. It was skillfully authored so looks quite good in motion. The audio is quite good with English subtitles.\n\nThere are six featurettes on the making of the film as well as a stills gallery and an excellent commentary track with Stephen Prince who wrote an excellent book on Peckinpah. There‚Äôs also a 50 minute documentary on Peckinpah as well.\n\nAlthough not his best film, ‚ÄúCross of Iron‚Äù is a very good movie taking an unusual approach to a war movie.

I recall being somewhat let down as James Coburn was just too long in the tooth to play the role of Sgt. Steiner. Hard to believe that over forty years later, my opinion about the movie has improved. Coburn was still too old for the part he played, but he acted the heck out of it.\n\nWar on the Russian Front was dirty is many ways. Sam Peckinpah‚Äôs direction is good, as is the film editing. Many different angles of the same shots were used in battle scenes, but spliced together, and from the angles used at times the shots did not look ‚Äúrepeated‚Äù. Pre CGI, and this is probably for the better.\n\nGreat cast worked well with each other, in this true, anti-war, war is hell movie sold by an earnest Coburn and the ever dependable James Mason. If you are interested in a little known area (this would include most audiences) of World War 2 This is a fine adaptation of Sven Hassle‚Äôs book.",

Lots of trademark Peckinpaugh violence in COI, as well as his overarching premise (as in almost all of his films) that authority/leadership are not to be trusted by the common man or soldier.\n\nCommentary in the film was very informative. Amazing that film was completed, in that money was running out and Peckinpaugh's behavior was very erratic on the set (he passed on not long after its release). I like the story about how they only had 3 Soviet style tanks to use in the film, so they had to film them as if there twice as many of them during the attack scenes.",

Recent biographies have traced the difficulties he had with this production, mostly money issues, but also script issues (and the script is perhaps the weakest part of this movie). By this point in his career, Peckinpah had already entered into the pitiful slide of addiction, and to some degree it shows in the pacing of this film: too long, a little slack, with his patented slow motion death scenes now becoming almost self-parody. All this said, this is a film still worth seeing and owning (I certainly plan to own this edition, wide-screen, commentary, and all). It's worth owning because, one, it is a Sam Peckinpah film, and Sam Peckinpah is unarguably one of the great filmmakers of the 6os and 70s. Hell, Convoy is even worth watching and owning, if just for one great shot of the trucks on the highway at night, a simply gorgeous image. And Cross of Iron, for all its problems with length and coherence, is still a powerful war film and still at many times a gorgeous film. Like all Peckinpah movies, this reeks of authenticity: the soldiers in their dishelved uniforms and bad teeth, the Germans (as they really did do) trading their Schmiesser machine pistols for the much better Russian submachine guns. The battle scenes are impressively and disturbingly chaotic. The climax, with Steiner's men crossing no-man's land into their own lines, is heartbreaking, an image that has stuck with me for nearly 30 years since I saw the film when it first came out. I don't know if in today's conservative climate one could make a movie about German soldiers in WWII; and Peckinpah takes perhaps an easy way out by making a clear distinction between the common Wermacht soldier and the evil SS troops (in the last decade or so there has been much scholarship about the atrocities committed by the regular, non SS, German Army in the Soviet Union, which decisively undercuts Peckinpah's distinction). This said, the bigger point that Peckinpah makes in this film still is valid: simply, war is hell, and at a certain point, winning and losing become meaningless. James Coburn, an always underrated actor, is excellent here as the weary and cynical squad leader Steiner, with able support by Maximillian Schell, James Mason, and David Warner. The rest of the cast is an effective and talented group of European actors. Despite what Orson Welles may have said, this is not the greatest anti-war movie ever made. It's not even near Peckinpah's best. But it's honest filmmaking by a master craftsman who still could drive a narrative with skill. This is an essential part of any Peckinpah fans film library, and worth seeing for any serious film goer.",

                    "reviewContent": "Cross Of Iron is a masterpiece, one of the greatest anti-war, anti-authoritarian movies. It is one of director Sam Peckinpah's two finest works -- the other being The Wild Bunch. It deserves to be ranked in the same great war movie company as Apocalypse Now, Das Boot, Full Metal Jacket, Paths Of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, Seven Samurai, and Zulu. Its setting on the World War Two Eastern Front, its gruesomeness, and its risk-taking viewpoint on ugly combat from the German side, have tended to count against fair assessment of its considerable artistic achievements. Viewers wary of the morality of its German viewpoint and its explicitness might find that it is fundamentally about humanity in general as a victim of war. The film reflects on the humanity which may be found on all sides of conflict--including Russian humanity portrayed variously as relentless, innocent, brave, and feminine.\n\nCross Of Iron opens with an intense, chilling montage of children's song, propaganda vision, combat newsreel and atrocity. By the end of the main title this montage subtly introduces the central characters, a German reconnaissance unit patrolling on the 1943 Russian front.\n\nThis 1977 film set rarely matched standards of cinematic mayhem. Cross Of Iron explosions don't look merely like pretty fireballs -- they blast fragments, rocks and debris, leaving no doubt as to why blood gouts from stumps of limbs and shrapnel-shredded entrails... Amid the screams of wounded and dying, as dust subsides from a mortar barrage, an artillery piece shorn of its crew by a near hit swings across a pocked battlefield, its traversing wheel spinning under its own momentum. The carnage occurs in the choreographed slow motion which Peckinpah made his signature.\n\nJames Coburn turns in one of his finest roles as Rolf Steiner, a highly decorated NCO who leads a German reconnaissance squad. Steiner fights less for his country than for his comrades. He has low opinions of class and rank distinctions. He is contemptuous both of Nazism and the aristocratic Prussian arrogance of his new superior officer, Captain Stransky, played with great style by Maximilian Schell. But there are hints of a dark side. Although Steiner is articulate and philosophical he has no answer when his love interest during an enforced break from battle, nurse Eva (Senta Berger), bitterly accuses him of being afraid of what he would be without the war.\n\nAmong the many fine supporting performances, James Mason plays the war-weary Colonel Brandt. He sees the immorality and futility of German war aims, but his sense of honour and duty about the prevailing struggle makes ceasing to fight unthinkable. David Warner plays Brandt's out-of-place and out-of-time adjutant, Captain Kiesel, who represents to his colonel the hope that a more enlightened postwar Germany might arise from the ashes of inevitable defeat.\n\nWar movie buffs irritated by the technical inaccuracies common in many examples of the genre will find some satisfaction in attention to authenticity of weaponry. A range of genuine WWII German and Russian small arms appears. The T 34/85 tanks are real, although the very picky might argue that this is at least six months premature, and that for the summer of '43 they should be T 34/76. Tactics at times deviate from the textbooks, but this is a drama, not a combat manual.\n\nCross Of Iron is a five-star movie. The Hen's Tooth Video release was a two-star DVD, with sub-standard picture and sound. It was worth owning only while this great film of a great American director lacked the high quality collectors' edition Zone 1 DVD release it deserves, or the far superior European DVD and Blu-ray releases it later received.\n\nUpdate in September 2011: It appears that only the DVD and Blu-ray releases of this film for the European market - notably those published by Studio Canal - are good quality transfers, as well as being in the original widescreen aspect ratio. Studio Canal's Blu-ray release (encoded for Region B only) is significantly better even than their DVD. It shows so much more detail compared to the DVD releases, for example, that the lettering and designs of German military awards like the Krim and Kuban Shield shoulder insignia can be seen clearly on screen, and wine and beer bottle labels are easily read. The Blu-ray is available from Amazon.co.uk, but can be played only on Region B-capable Blu-ray decks. Extras on this Blu-ray include a gem, a documentary by Mike Siegel called \"Passion & Poetry - Sam Peckinpah's War\". This gives fascinating insight into the making of \"Cross of Iron\" and Peckinpah's directorial style through contemporary and later interviews with James Coburn, David Warner, Senta Berger, Maximilian Schell, Roger Fritz, Vadim Glowna, Katy Haber and Peckinpah himself. It includes a shot of Peckinpah reminiscing proudly about receiving a telegram from Orson Welles saying it was 'one of the finest war films ever made'. Welles was so right.",

In this movie, Feldwebel Steiner (played by James Coburn) leads a Reconnaissance platoon (more like a squad) that has received a new company commander, Hauptmann Stransky who has arrived from a posting in France with the focus of winning the Iron Cross. To gain the Iron Cross Hauptmann Stransky is prepared to do whatever is necessary.\n\nThe Good\nThe characters are great. James Coburn is outstanding as the seasoned veteran leading his section and he does a great job in this role. Maximilian Schell is also good playing Hauptmann Stransky; he's everything we want to hate in an officer that focuses on himself and not his men. James Mason plays the regimental commander that is sympathetic to Steiner and does a good job in this role.\n\nThe action is fast and very nice. While bloody at times, it fits with how war movies should be and captures what I've read about the actions on the Eastern Front from history books.\n\nThe story takes place on the Crimean Peninsula and is woven around the actual battles that took place there in that timeframe. While the regiment is not directly mentioned, the dress and bearing is that of one of the many infantry regiments that would have fought there.\n\nShowing Russian women in service. For the time period this movie was made in that was something that many people in the West weren't aware of. Since that time it's become more common knowledge but this would have been one of the earlier references to it.\n\nI also loved the uniforms. Mr. Peckinpah didn't make the mistake of using later war camouflage uniforms or SS uniforms. Matter of fact, I love the fact that this is around a regular infantry unit rather than a SS or elite unit.\n\nThe Bad\nIgnoring the minor things (use of F4U's for Russian aircraft and T-34/85's vs T-34/76's), I have an issue with James Coburn's age when this was filmed. Coburn looks in his late 40's or early 50's. You don't expect a Feldwebel leading a recon platoon to be that old (it can happen though).\n\nI also had a problem with the fact that Hauptmann Stransky bounces in to get the Iron Cross and then is bouncing back to France. I'm sorry, at that point in the war that would be highly unlikely, even for a member of the former aristocracy. Something like that would have been more likely if Hauptmann Stransky had been assigned to Italy, but then we wouldn't have the story set in the Crimean.\n\nThe conflict between Feldwebel Steiner and Hauptmann Stransky was to close to a Vietnam thing. I won't say that German officers wouldn't lie to get something they wanted, I will say though that Steiner would have been very out of character for a Feldwebel and probably sentenced to a Penal Battalion.\n\nThe alcohol flows a little freely for a unit on the Eastern Front. If they were in France or Italy I could say yes, but there's a lot of it and it's not vodka they show (actually beer and wine).\n\nThe Rating\nA Solid 4.5 stars! The acting is solid, the story moves and has a purpose. I love the interplay between Steiner and Stransky. You see two men who are very different, one rich, one who's working class. I also love the camaraderie between Steiner and his men. This is something that occurs when people share tragic events and continue to live. There is a little sexual content and the battle scenes are a little graphic (for when the film was made. Since Amazon requires whole numbers, I'll have to give the nod to 4 stars because to much of the film reminded me of the strife between US officers and enlisted people in the early '70's rather than what we read about the German Army in 1943. A very good movie thought that I'll highly recommend.",

                    "reviewContent": "This film is really Sam Peckinpah's last truly great work. I like his movies because films with guts aren't made a lot in Hollywood these days. His best films could be brutally honest and gut wrenching. I like this film because I like Peckinpah as a director and have studied for many years the Russian front and like watching World War II films. And the first time I watched 'Cross of Iron' I was kinda blown away. Are there flaws? Yes. But the film really captures a bit of the essence that was the Eastern front. The opening credits with footage and a children song playing in the background is great. The footage of Hitler, the Eastern Front, the cheering crowds is pretty overwhelming. One of my favorite opening credit sequences. The remarkable thing was that 'Cross of Iron' was accomplished with a budget of around 6 million dollars. In comparison from the same year, 'A Bridge Too Far', had a budget of 26 million dollars. 'Cross of Iron' truly has very good battle scenes including a very gripping sequence of a attack by Soviet T-34 tanks that is one of the highlights of the picture. Also, I love the detail of the scene with a water cooled machine gun. Really excellent military detail.\n\nThe film also has a scene that shows how death was so casual on the Eastern front where millions died. A dead German soldier has been ground into the road by trucks and other vehicles running over him and no one cares. This is a very strong but quick scene in the movie\n\nJames Coburn is very strong as Steiner and pretty much anchors the picture. Schell, Mason, and Warner are very good also. The uniforms and the equipment are pretty good representations and as mentioned before the scene where Steiner and his men try to hold off the T-34s seems to be a precursor to similar scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan.'\n\nThe Special Edition DVD while expensive is at least in the near proper aspect ratio and enhanced for widescreen TVs. It is a nice improvement over the previous DVD. The picture is good but the sound could be better. There is a informative commentary track by Stephen Prince who also did the commentary track for Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs'. The commentary track is quite good and manages to cover the real World War II history behind the film, differences with the novel, and the actual making of the film quite well. It is really worth a listen. The only other extras are viewable lobby cards and a hyperbolic trailer.\n\nFans should pick up the novel too by Willi Heinrich. It is interesting to compare the two and see how different they are.\n\nOne of my favorites films from one of my favorite directors! Highly recommended!\n\nThis ranks with my other favorite theatrical war films about WWII: 'A Bridge Too Far', 'Downfall', 'Stalingrad', 'Das Boot', 'Letters from Iwo Jima' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.",

The film benefits from strong performances of James Coburn and James Mason along with strong period detail and a compelling story. It isn‚Äôt his best movie but it remains a strong movie.\n\nOf course Peckinpah took a unique approach to the subject; his film focuses on German infantry men fighting during the Russian campaign. Steiner (Coburn) and his men struggle to survive in a foreign land. He finds his decisions called into question by his new commander (Maximillian Schell) who believes the propaganda about how invincible the Germans are and focuses only glory.\n\nHen‚Äôs Tooth releases this using the same transfer as the UK release except it is considerably more compressed. It was skillfully authored so looks quite good in motion. The audio is quite good with English subtitles.\n\nThere are six featurettes on the making of the film as well as a stills gallery and an excellent commentary track with Stephen Prince who wrote an excellent book on Peckinpah. There‚Äôs also a 50 minute documentary on Peckinpah as well.\n\nAlthough not his best film, ‚ÄúCross of Iron‚Äù is a very good movie taking an unusual approach to a war movie. He focuses on the average German fighting in Russia against the odds.",

I recall being somewhat let down as James Coburn was just too long in the tooth to play the role of Sgt. Steiner. Hard to believe that over forty years later, my opinion about the movie has improved. Coburn was still too old for the part he played, but he acted the heck out of it.\n\nWar on the Russian Front was dirty is many ways. Sam Peckinpah‚Äôs direction is good, as is the film editing. Many different angles of the same shots were used in battle scenes, but spliced together, and from the angles used at times the shots did not look ‚Äúrepeated‚Äù. Pre CGI, and this is probably for the better.\n\nGreat cast worked well with each other, in this true, anti-war, war is hell movie sold by an earnest Coburn and the ever dependable James Mason. If you are interested in a little known area (this would include most audiences) of World War 2 This is a fine adaptation of Sven Hassle‚Äôs book.",

I had a import version on DVD, the quality was ok, but I decided to upgrade to this release.\n\nPicture & sound are a bit better, and the packaging is superior (beats having to look at Korean lettering & words on the case, as with my other DVD).\n\nSo yeah, there are not too many war movies made about the German vs Soviet conflict on the Eastern Front in WWII. Lots of trademark Peckinpaugh violence in COI, as well as his overarching premise (as in almost all of his films) that authority/leadership are not to be trusted by the common man or soldier.\n\nCommentary in the film was very informative. Amazing that film was completed, in that money was running out and Peckinpaugh's behavior was very erratic on the set (he passed on not long after its release). I like the story about how they only had 3 Soviet style tanks to use in the film, so they had to film them as if there twice as many of them during the attack scenes.",

Recent biographies have traced the difficulties he had with this production, mostly money issues, but also script issues (and the script is perhaps the weakest part of this movie). By this point in his career, Peckinpah had already entered into the pitiful slide of addiction, and to some degree it shows in the pacing of this film: too long, a little slack, with his patented slow motion death scenes now becoming almost self-parody. All this said, this is a film still worth seeing and owning (I certainly plan to own this edition, wide-screen, commentary, and all). It's worth owning because, one, it is a Sam Peckinpah film, and Sam Peckinpah is unarguably one of the great filmmakers of the 6os and 70s. Hell, Convoy is even worth watching and owning, if just for one great shot of the trucks on the highway at night, a simply gorgeous image. And Cross of Iron, for all its problems with length and coherence, is still a powerful war film and still at many times a gorgeous film. Like all Peckinpah movies, this reeks of authenticity: the soldiers in their dishelved uniforms and bad teeth, the Germans (as they really did do) trading their Schmiesser machine pistols for the much better Russian submachine guns. The battle scenes are impressively and disturbingly chaotic. The climax, with Steiner's men crossing no-man's land into their own lines, is heartbreaking, an image that has stuck with me for nearly 30 years since I saw the film when it first came out. I don't know if in today's conservative climate one could make a movie about German soldiers in WWII; and Peckinpah takes perhaps an easy way out by making a clear distinction between the common Wermacht soldier and the evil SS troops (in the last decade or so there has been much scholarship about the atrocities committed by the regular, non SS, German Army in the Soviet Union, which decisively undercuts Peckinpah's distinction). This said, the bigger point that Peckinpah makes in this film still is valid: simply, war is hell, and at a certain point, winning and losing become meaningless. James Coburn, an always underrated actor, is excellent here as the weary and cynical squad leader Steiner, with able support by Maximillian Schell, James Mason, and David Warner. The rest of the cast is an effective and talented group of European actors. Despite what Orson Welles may have said, this is not the greatest anti-war movie ever made. It's not even near Peckinpah's best. But it's honest filmmaking by a master craftsman who still could drive a narrative with skill. This is an essential part of any Peckinpah fans film library, and worth seeing for any serious film goer.",

I found them actually ridiculous at times. I then I remembered how no one can get you angrier than your family, yet no one can love and forgive us like our family. Sadly many families let anger keep them apart. The bitterness and lies of their father poisoned and robbed the rest of the family of years with each other. I can relate to family drama, having experienced it myself. I can testify that nothing is better than working it out and excepting each other like we are. I hope this book can influence you and positive ways like it to the characters.",

                    "reviewContent": "Cross Of Iron is a masterpiece, one of the greatest anti-war, anti-authoritarian movies. It is one of director Sam Peckinpah's two finest works -- the other being The Wild Bunch. It deserves to be ranked in the same great war movie company as Apocalypse Now, Das Boot, Full Metal Jacket, Paths Of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, Seven Samurai, and Zulu. Its setting on the World War Two Eastern Front, its gruesomeness, and its risk-taking viewpoint on ugly combat from the German side, have tended to count against fair assessment of its considerable artistic achievements. Viewers wary of the morality of its German viewpoint and its explicitness might find that it is fundamentally about humanity in general as a victim of war. The film reflects on the humanity which may be found on all sides of conflict--including Russian humanity portrayed variously as relentless, innocent, brave, and feminine.\n\nCross Of Iron opens with an intense, chilling montage of children's song, propaganda vision, combat newsreel and atrocity. By the end of the main title this montage subtly introduces the central characters, a German reconnaissance unit patrolling on the 1943 Russian front.\n\nThis 1977 film set rarely matched standards of cinematic mayhem. Cross Of Iron explosions don't look merely like pretty fireballs -- they blast fragments, rocks and debris, leaving no doubt as to why blood gouts from stumps of limbs and shrapnel-shredded entrails... Amid the screams of wounded and dying, as dust subsides from a mortar barrage, an artillery piece shorn of its crew by a near hit swings across a pocked battlefield, its traversing wheel spinning under its own momentum. The carnage occurs in the choreographed slow motion which Peckinpah made his signature.\n\nJames Coburn turns in one of his finest roles as Rolf Steiner, a highly decorated NCO who leads a German reconnaissance squad. Steiner fights less for his country than for his comrades. He has low opinions of class and rank distinctions. He is contemptuous both of Nazism and the aristocratic Prussian arrogance of his new superior officer, Captain Stransky, played with great style by Maximilian Schell. But there are hints of a dark side. Although Steiner is articulate and philosophical he has no answer when his love interest during an enforced break from battle, nurse Eva (Senta Berger), bitterly accuses him of being afraid of what he would be without the war.\n\nAmong the many fine supporting performances, James Mason plays the war-weary Colonel Brandt. He sees the immorality and futility of German war aims, but his sense of honour and duty about the prevailing struggle makes ceasing to fight unthinkable. David Warner plays Brandt's out-of-place and out-of-time adjutant, Captain Kiesel, who represents to his colonel the hope that a more enlightened postwar Germany might arise from the ashes of inevitable defeat.\n\nWar movie buffs irritated by the technical inaccuracies common in many examples of the genre will find some satisfaction in attention to authenticity of weaponry. A range of genuine WWII German and Russian small arms appears. The T 34/85 tanks are real, although the very picky might argue that this is at least six months premature, and that for the summer of '43 they should be T 34/76. Tactics at times deviate from the textbooks, but this is a drama, not a combat manual.\n\nCross Of Iron is a five-star movie. The Hen's Tooth Video release was a two-star DVD, with sub-standard picture and sound. It was worth owning only while this great film of a great American director lacked the high quality collectors' edition Zone 1 DVD release it deserves, or the far superior European DVD and Blu-ray releases it later received.\n\nUpdate in September 2011: It appears that only the DVD and Blu-ray releases of this film for the European market - notably those published by Studio Canal - are good quality transfers, as well as being in the original widescreen aspect ratio. Studio Canal's Blu-ray release (encoded for Region B only) is significantly better even than their DVD. It shows so much more detail compared to the DVD releases, for example, that the lettering and designs of German military awards like the Krim and Kuban Shield shoulder insignia can be seen clearly on screen, and wine and beer bottle labels are easily read. The Blu-ray is available from Amazon.co.uk, but can be played only on Region B-capable Blu-ray decks. Extras on this Blu-ray include a gem, a documentary by Mike Siegel called \"Passion & Poetry - Sam Peckinpah's War\". This gives fascinating insight into the making of \"Cross of Iron\" and Peckinpah's directorial style through contemporary and later interviews with James Coburn, David Warner, Senta Berger, Maximilian Schell, Roger Fritz, Vadim Glowna, Katy Haber and Peckinpah himself. It includes a shot of Peckinpah reminiscing proudly about receiving a telegram from Orson Welles saying it was 'one of the finest war films ever made'. Welles was so right.",

                    "reviewContent": "Overview\nCross of Iron is director Sam Peckinpah's look at the German Army on the Eastern Front in 1943. In this movie, Feldwebel Steiner (played by James Coburn) leads a Reconnaissance platoon (more like a squad) that has received a new company commander, Hauptmann Stransky who has arrived from a posting in France with the focus of winning the Iron Cross. To gain the Iron Cross Hauptmann Stransky is prepared to do whatever is necessary.\n\nThe Good\nThe characters are great. James Coburn is outstanding as the seasoned veteran leading his section and he does a great job in this role. Maximilian Schell is also good playing Hauptmann Stransky; he's everything we want to hate in an officer that focuses on himself and not his men. James Mason plays the regimental commander that is sympathetic to Steiner and does a good job in this role.\n\nThe action is fast and very nice. While bloody at times, it fits with how war movies should be and captures what I've read about the actions on the Eastern Front from history books.\n\nThe story takes place on the Crimean Peninsula and is woven around the actual battles that took place there in that timeframe. While the regiment is not directly mentioned, the dress and bearing is that of one of the many infantry regiments that would have fought there.\n\nShowing Russian women in service. For the time period this movie was made in that was something that many people in the West weren't aware of. Since that time it's become more common knowledge but this would have been one of the earlier references to it.\n\nI also loved the uniforms. Mr. Peckinpah didn't make the mistake of using later war camouflage uniforms or SS uniforms. Matter of fact, I love the fact that this is around a regular infantry unit rather than a SS or elite unit.\n\nThe Bad\nIgnoring the minor things (use of F4U's for Russian aircraft and T-34/85's vs T-34/76's), I have an issue with James Coburn's age when this was filmed. Coburn looks in his late 40's or early 50's. You don't expect a Feldwebel leading a recon platoon to be that old (it can happen though).\n\nI also had a problem with the fact that Hauptmann Stransky bounces in to get the Iron Cross and then is bouncing back to France. I'm sorry, at that point in the war that would be highly unlikely, even for a member of the former aristocracy. Something like that would have been more likely if Hauptmann Stransky had been assigned to Italy, but then we wouldn't have the story set in the Crimean.\n\nThe conflict between Feldwebel Steiner and Hauptmann Stransky was to close to a Vietnam thing. I won't say that German officers wouldn't lie to get something they wanted, I will say though that Steiner would have been very out of character for a Feldwebel and probably sentenced to a Penal Battalion.\n\nThe alcohol flows a little freely for a unit on the Eastern Front. If they were in France or Italy I could say yes, but there's a lot of it and it's not vodka they show (actually beer and wine).\n\nThe Rating\nA Solid 4.5 stars! The acting is solid, the story moves and has a purpose. I love the interplay between Steiner and Stransky. You see two men who are very different, one rich, one who's working class. I also love the camaraderie between Steiner and his men. This is something that occurs when people share tragic events and continue to live. There is a little sexual content and the battle scenes are a little graphic (for when the film was made. Since Amazon requires whole numbers, I'll have to give the nod to 4 stars because to much of the film reminded me of the strife between US officers and enlisted people in the early '70's rather than what we read about the German Army in 1943. A very good movie thought that I'll highly recommend.",

                    "reviewContent": "This film is really Sam Peckinpah's last truly great work. I like his movies because films with guts aren't made a lot in Hollywood these days. His best films could be brutally honest and gut wrenching. I like this film because I like Peckinpah as a director and have studied for many years the Russian front and like watching World War II films. And the first time I watched 'Cross of Iron' I was kinda blown away. Are there flaws? Yes. But the film really captures a bit of the essence that was the Eastern front. The opening credits with footage and a children song playing in the background is great. The footage of Hitler, the Eastern Front, the cheering crowds is pretty overwhelming. One of my favorite opening credit sequences. The remarkable thing was that 'Cross of Iron' was accomplished with a budget of around 6 million dollars. In comparison from the same year, 'A Bridge Too Far', had a budget of 26 million dollars. 'Cross of Iron' truly has very good battle scenes including a very gripping sequence of a attack by Soviet T-34 tanks that is one of the highlights of the picture. Also, I love the detail of the scene with a water cooled machine gun. Really excellent military detail.\n\nThe film also has a scene that shows how death was so casual on the Eastern front where millions died. A dead German soldier has been ground into the road by trucks and other vehicles running over him and no one cares. This is a very strong but quick scene in the movie\n\nJames Coburn is very strong as Steiner and pretty much anchors the picture. Schell, Mason, and Warner are very good also. The uniforms and the equipment are pretty good representations and as mentioned before the scene where Steiner and his men try to hold off the T-34s seems to be a precursor to similar scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan.'\n\nThe Special Edition DVD while expensive is at least in the near proper aspect ratio and enhanced for widescreen TVs. It is a nice improvement over the previous DVD. The picture is good but the sound could be better. There is a informative commentary track by Stephen Prince who also did the commentary track for Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs'. The commentary track is quite good and manages to cover the real World War II history behind the film, differences with the novel, and the actual making of the film quite well. It is really worth a listen. The only other extras are viewable lobby cards and a hyperbolic trailer.\n\nFans should pick up the novel too by Willi Heinrich. It is interesting to compare the two and see how different they are.\n\nOne of my favorites films from one of my favorite directors! Highly recommended!\n\nThis ranks with my other favorite theatrical war films about WWII: 'A Bridge Too Far', 'Downfall', 'Stalingrad', 'Das Boot', 'Letters from Iwo Jima' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.",

The film benefits from strong performances of James Coburn and James Mason along with strong period detail and a compelling story. It isn‚Äôt his best movie but it remains a strong movie.\n\nOf course Peckinpah took a unique approach to the subject; his film focuses on German infantry men fighting during the Russian campaign. Steiner (Coburn) and his men struggle to survive in a foreign land. He finds his decisions called into question by his new commander (Maximillian Schell) who believes the propaganda about how invincible the Germans are and focuses only glory.\n\nHen‚Äôs Tooth releases this using the same transfer as the UK release except it is considerably more compressed. It was skillfully authored so looks quite good in motion. The audio is quite good with English subtitles.\n\nThere are six featurettes on the making of the film as well as a stills gallery and an excellent commentary track with Stephen Prince who wrote an excellent book on Peckinpah. There‚Äôs also a 50 minute documentary on Peckinpah as well.\n\nAlthough not his best film, ‚ÄúCross of Iron‚Äù is a very good movie taking an unusual approach to a war movie. He focuses on the average German fighting in Russia against the odds.",

I recall being somewhat let down as James Coburn was just too long in the tooth to play the role of Sgt. Steiner. Hard to believe that over forty years later, my opinion about the movie has improved. Coburn was still too old for the part he played, but he acted the heck out of it.\n\nWar on the Russian Front was dirty is many ways. Sam Peckinpah‚Äôs direction is good, as is the film editing. Many different angles of the same shots were used in battle scenes, but spliced together, and from the angles used at times the shots did not look ‚Äúrepeated‚Äù. Pre CGI, and this is probably for the better.\n\nGreat cast worked well with each other, in this true, anti-war, war is hell movie sold by an earnest Coburn and the ever dependable James Mason. If you are interested in a little known area (this would include most audiences) of World War 2 This is a fine adaptation of Sven Hassle‚Äôs book.",

I had a import version on DVD, the quality was ok, but I decided to upgrade to this release.\n\nPicture & sound are a bit better, and the packaging is superior (beats having to look at Korean lettering & words on the case, as with my other DVD).\n\nSo yeah, there are not too many war movies made about the German vs Soviet conflict on the Eastern Front in WWII. Lots of trademark Peckinpaugh violence in COI, as well as his overarching premise (as in almost all of his films) that authority/leadership are not to be trusted by the common man or soldier.\n\nCommentary in the film was very informative. Amazing that film was completed, in that money was running out and Peckinpaugh's behavior was very erratic on the set (he passed on not long after its release). I like the story about how they only had 3 Soviet style tanks to use in the film, so they had to film them as if there twice as many of them during the attack scenes.",

Recent biographies have traced the difficulties he had with this production, mostly money issues, but also script issues (and the script is perhaps the weakest part of this movie). By this point in his career, Peckinpah had already entered into the pitiful slide of addiction, and to some degree it shows in the pacing of this film: too long, a little slack, with his patented slow motion death scenes now becoming almost self-parody. All this said, this is a film still worth seeing and owning (I certainly plan to own this edition, wide-screen, commentary, and all). It's worth owning because, one, it is a Sam Peckinpah film, and Sam Peckinpah is unarguably one of the great filmmakers of the 6os and 70s. Hell, Convoy is even worth watching and owning, if just for one great shot of the trucks on the highway at night, a simply gorgeous image. And Cross of Iron, for all its problems with length and coherence, is still a powerful war film and still at many times a gorgeous film. Like all Peckinpah movies, this reeks of authenticity: the soldiers in their dishelved uniforms and bad teeth, the Germans (as they really did do) trading their Schmiesser machine pistols for the much better Russian submachine guns. The battle scenes are impressively and disturbingly chaotic. The climax, with Steiner's men crossing no-man's land into their own lines, is heartbreaking, an image that has stuck with me for nearly 30 years since I saw the film when it first came out. I don't know if in today's conservative climate one could make a movie about German soldiers in WWII; and Peckinpah takes perhaps an easy way out by making a clear distinction between the common Wermacht soldier and the evil SS troops (in the last decade or so there has been much scholarship about the atrocities committed by the regular, non SS, German Army in the Soviet Union, which decisively undercuts Peckinpah's distinction). This said, the bigger point that Peckinpah makes in this film still is valid: simply, war is hell, and at a certain point, winning and losing become meaningless. James Coburn, an always underrated actor, is excellent here as the weary and cynical squad leader Steiner, with able support by Maximillian Schell, James Mason, and David Warner. The rest of the cast is an effective and talented group of European actors. Despite what Orson Welles may have said, this is not the greatest anti-war movie ever made. It's not even near Peckinpah's best. But it's honest filmmaking by a master craftsman who still could drive a narrative with skill. This is an essential part of any Peckinpah fans film library, and worth seeing for any serious film goer.",
