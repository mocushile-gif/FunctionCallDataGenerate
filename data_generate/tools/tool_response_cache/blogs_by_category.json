We don\u2019t want to make mistakes when we speak in a public gathering. Whatever the cause of your public speaking anxiety, you can overcome it with these five steps:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.Face your fear\\r\\nBefore you resolve any problem you are facing, the first thing is to be realistic and admit that such a problem exists. Acknowledge that it exists, and have faith that you will overcome it. When you become courageous enough to face your fear, then you will overcome it.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.Be knowledgeable of what you will deliver\\r\\nIt will be of great help to you if you know your material thoroughly, not only memorizing it. You have to have good knowledge of the information you want to pass across, the main message and your key points. To be calm and relaxed on stage, just be prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.Don\u2019t think it\u2019s all about you\\r\\nWhen making a public speech or addressing a crowd, we mostly think that everyone is looking at us, and thus this will make us uncomfortable. Before making a public speech, we need to adjust the way we see things. Change your mindset and know that although everybody in the room is looking at us, in reality, half of them are more interested in the message or content we are delivering, while their own thoughts and other irrelevant things carry the rest away. \\r\\n\\r\\n4.Interact with your audience\\r\\nWhen addressing the public, a big way to release the tension in you and free yourself from public speaking anxiety is by interacting with your audience. This can be done by getting them engaged and doing certain things like asking leading questions, bring up a story you can relate to and many more. As you interact w"

Getting enough sleep is necessary for your body to operate as it should. While the amount of sleep you need differs from person to person, it\u2019s generally recommended that adults get between 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night.  In today\u2019s fast-paced world, it\u2019s common to \u201cget by\u201d on a lot less. Many people are so sleep-deprived, they don\u2019t even notice the effects on their bodies! Some people even brag about how little they sleep, or how they \u201crun on coffee\u201d. \\r\\n\\r\\nSleep is so essential, that not getting enough sleep is correlated to everything from weight gain, to heart disease, weakening of the immune system, distractibility that can lead to increased risk of accidents, and much more. \\r\\n\\r\\nNightmares in adults can be caused by certain types of medication; PTSD, depression, anxiety or sleep disorders; stress and more. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can you do when you\u2019re struggling with sleep deprivation due to recurring nightmares?\\r\\n\\r\\n\u25cfGet out of bed. Don\u2019t torture yourself by lying in bed for hours after waking up from a nightmare. If you can\u2019t fall back asleep, get out of bed. Make yourself some chamomile tea, go for a five-minute walk or take a shower. Doing this can give your body and mind a kind of \u201creset\u201d that will help you fall back asleep quickly. \\r\\n\u25cfKeep a dream journal. When you wake up from a dream, write down everything you can remember about it. You\u2019ll probably find out common themes that keep showing up in the nightmares. When you identify these themes, you can look closely at your life and deal with the issues. \\r\\n\u25cfTalk it out. Bottling things up makes them have a stronger hold on you. In addition to the relief you\u2019ll f"
