If most of your work is organized around an activity that's considered fashionable, you will never succeed in feeling good about yourself or your creations. You're too motivated by meaningful activities to spend your time with frivolous ones. Today's aspects will push you to cut yourself off from all that doesn't resonate deeply.\", 'lucky_number': 3}"

Today is the perfect time for you to prove this theory wrong. There's a great deal of force out there to help you boost your rocket off the launching pad.

Quality is more important than speed, and a peaceful mind is more efficient and productive than a stressed one.\", 'lucky_number': 7}"
