MyMemory is the world's largest Translation Memory that contains billions of words translated by professional translators. MyMemory will give you ModernMT machine translation  if a human translation is not available.\nAPI description: This API gets a list of translation from the translation memory ranked by quality and similarity (what we call match). MyMemory will check if a sentence has been already translated in the private TM specified. If we don't find it in the private TM of the translator, we search it in the public TMs (shared among all the translators). Again, if we don't have this translation we ask MT providers to generate it.  In order to get the best from MyMemory, it is highly recommended to use different keys for each tran",
