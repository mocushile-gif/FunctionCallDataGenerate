Letters from the first row of the board should be listed first reading from left to right, followed by letters from the second row and so on down the board. On a traditional Boggle board, the letters 'Q' and 'U' appear together on a single square, in order to be consistent with this rule the web service will interpret the single letter 'Q' as the sequence 'QU'.\nAPI description: Finds possible words from the given Boggle board letters using the RapidAPI Codebox Boggle endpoint.",
