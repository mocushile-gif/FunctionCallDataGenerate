This API provides endpoints for calculating A Body Shape Index (ABSI), Adjusted Body Weight (AjBW), Basal Energy Expenditure (BEE) and Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) , Body Adiposity Index (BAI), Body Frame Size Index (BFSI), Body Mass Index (BMI), Body Fat Percentage, Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Daily Caloric Needs (DCN), Daily Water Intake (DWI), Estimated Average Glucose(eAG), Estimated Energy Requirement (EER), The FFMI (Fat-Free Mass Index), Ta...\nAPI description: This endpoint allows you to calculate the ideal weight range based on factors like height, body frame size, and gender. The endpoint provides different formulas and approaches for ideal weight estimation, such as the Hamwi method and the Devine formula.",
