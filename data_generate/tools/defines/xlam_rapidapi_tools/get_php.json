It is not, like many others, a basic TF-IDF analysis. It compare the text against a very large language model, it uses a probabilistic model to identify candidates, it supports  multi-words terms and not only single words. It uses part of speech tagging to clean up the results\". In short it is probably the most advanced term extraction out there.\nAPI description: Fetch terminology extraction from a given text in a specified language using RapidAPI.",
