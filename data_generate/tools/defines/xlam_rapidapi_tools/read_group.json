IronWifi authenticates the user based on the updated credentials.\r\n\r\nTo receive technical assistance with your IronWifi API project, or to discuss any advanced requirements that you may have, please contact us at support@ironwifi.com, or call +1 (800) 963-6221.\nAPI description: Fetches information of a specific group from the IronWiFi API using the given group ID.",
